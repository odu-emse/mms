Sensitivity analysis is a powerful tool that allows us to examine the effects of changes to the parameters of an LP model. Specifically, we will cover the concepts of shadow prices, allowable ranges, and binding constraints, and how to interpret them in the context of an LP model.  We will start by discussing manual sensitivity analysis, where we use the Simplex tableau to make changes to the parameters of an LP model and observe the effects on the optimal solution. We will then move on to automatic sensitivity analysis, where we use software tools to perform sensitivity analysis automatically. Finally, we will discuss some practical applications of sensitivity analysis, including how to use it to make informed decisions about changes to the parameters of an LP model.",
