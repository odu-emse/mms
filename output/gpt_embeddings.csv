Course Introduction,1.0,CEFA,"Title: Course Introduction; Description: In the video, the instructor of the course ENMA 600 provides an overview of the syllabus and the focus of the course, which is cost estimation and financial analysis. The textbook being used is Principles of Managerial Finance, but it will not be strictly followed as the course will focus on areas relevant to engineering professionals. All necessary materials for the course, including the textbook, CD-Rom, and course package, are provided. The course package includes course slides, examples, and homework problems for reference.
Homework is emphasized as essential for learning the course material, even though it will not be collected or graded. The course objectives include explaining key concepts, demonstrating critical thinking skills, applying the material to real-life issues, and understanding the personal and social implications of financial analysis and cost estimation.
The evaluation component of the course consists of three equally weighted exams, which are open book and take-home exams. These exams must be completed individually without any assistance from others or external materials. Each exam covers specific areas of focus but may require knowledge from earlier material. Strict deadlines are set for the exams, and no late exams will be accepted. The scores on the exams will determine the overall course grade.
Academic integrity is emphasized, and cheating or plagiarism will result in disciplinary action. The keys to success in the course include watching every lecture, completing homework, seeking help when needed, learning to use spreadsheet programs, thinking critically about ambiguous situations, and keeping up with the reading.
The course focuses on basic accounting tools, engineering economics, and their role in organizational decision-making processes. Financial analysis involves interpreting financial data prepared by accountants, while cost estimation focuses on the application of capital budgeting techniques used in engineering economics.
Overall, the course aims to provide students with an integrated understanding of accounting, financial analysis, and investment decision-making. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of these functions and encourages students to recognize the broader societal context in which business operates. The importance of societal values, regulations, and standards in shaping business practices is highlighted. Students are encouraged to consider the impact of businesses on society and the need for business practices to reflect societal values. The course also addresses non-monetary issues such as income distribution, climate change, preservation of biodiversity, and human rights. The overarching goal is to equip students with the knowledge and skills to navigate financial aspects of decision-making and analyze engineering projects from a financial perspective while considering the broader societal implications.; Transcript: Well, greetings and welcome to the first lecture of NMR 600 cost estimation and financial analysis. My name is Corey Searcy and I'll be your lecturer for this semester. Every class is going to start off with a session overview, very similar to the one on the screen here. What we're going to do today is start off by talking about the syllabus. I'll hit on just a couple of the key points from that syllabus and then we'll talk a little bit about the course in general. I'll provide a course overview and talk a little bit about engineering, business and society. And the main purpose of these last two topics is just to try to help put the rest of the course into context. Now, much of the material in over the next couple of slides is summarized in the course syllabus. And as I said, I'm just going to hit on a couple of key points to make sure that you are aware of them. The course is self contained, so everything that you need to complete this course is provided in either the textbook or the CD Rom or the course package that you've been provided with when you started this course. First and foremost is the textbook. And what we're going to be using in this course is the most recent edition of the Principles of Managerial Finance by Lawrence J. Getman. It's a very good textbook, but I do want to note right off the bat that we won't follow it exactly.

We're going to focus on the area's most relevant to engineering professionals with an overall emphasis on cost estimation and financial analysis. In some places, the textbook does go into more detail than you may need for the purposes of this course and in other places, there's parts where I'll need to supplement the material in the textbook and where that's the case, I'll try to make you aware of that as we're going through the lectures. Of course you're going to be provided with all the course slides, so everything that you see in the lectures here are included in the course package and will be available for your reference at any time. You'll note that there's many examples that have been included in the course package and on the CD-Rom in both PDF and Excel format. Some of those examples I will be reviewing in class. So I actually will bring them into the lecture and put them up on the screen. Others you'll be expected to review on your own. In many cases I will make reference to those examples and just note that this might be a good time to review those. But if I don't mention them in the lecture for whatever reason, you can consult the course syllabus to see when the best time would be to review those examples. You also note that homework problems for each module are included in the course package. And again, when you should complete this homework is identified in the course syllabus.

I do want to note very explicitly that the homework is for your benefit and it is absolutely essential to learning the course material. However, it will not be collected and it will not be graded. Okay, so the homework is for your benefit, but it doesn't make up any percentage in terms of the course grade. And we'll talk about the course grades in a few moments. In any case, the solutions to each homework problem are provided in the course package. As you move through the material, it may be useful to keep the following objectives in mind. And again, these are detailed in the course syllabus, but just to spend a few minutes on them so you know what to expect and why we're undertaking this course. First and foremost, at the end of this course, everybody should be able to explain and describe the key concepts pertaining to financial analysis and cost estimation. And this will be one of the main features of the lectures. So we will talk about these key concepts in each of the lectures. And of course the textbook will also provide you with some additional insight into those concepts. You'll be expected to demonstrate the critical thinking skills needed to apply the content. You'll be able to apply the subjects covered to other real life issues and problems related to your own work settings. And I think that this is one of the major points of emphasis in the course.

I hope that you'll find that much of the material we cover is highly relevant in the business world and also in your personal life as well. You should be able to describe and explain the personal and social implications related to this subject. And this is something that will periodically come up throughout the course. In fact, in this lecture, we're going to talk a little bit about some of the social implications associated with the material we'll be learning in this course. And last but not least, we'll expect that you'll be able to apply the monetary aspects of engineering in integrated ways. As we're going through the course, you'll see that many of the subjects are introduced on their own. But one of the points that I'll make repeatedly is we do go through the entire course is that many of these subjects are interrelated and you'll need to understand all of them and how they relate to each other in order to have a very good understanding of this material. So that may seem like a lot, but again, the material that you've been provided with, I think should help you to achieve those goals. Now to see how well you've met those objectives, there is, of course, an evaluation component in this course, and basically the evaluation will be based on three equally weighted exams. So we'll have three exams and each of them is worth 33.3%.

All the exams are open book and take home exams. I want to note that everything taught in the course may be tested, so anything covered in the lectures, the examples, the homework, the assigned readings, all of that is eligible to be tested. The exams must be completed individually. Okay. So although they are open book and you are able to use any of the material provided in this course to complete the exam, you must do it on your own without reference to any other person or any materials outside of this course. The exams are non-cumulative. Okay, so exam one, exam two and exam three will each have their own unique areas of focus. But that doesn't necessarily mean that you won't need to remember the material covered in exam one and two for exam three for. For instance, as you'll see as we get into this course, much of the material builds on on itself and you'll see that you actually need to remember things covered earlier on in the course in order to complete material later on in the course. Each exam will be due one week after being received from the proctor and absolutely no late exams will be accepted. So when you're ready to take the exam, make sure you let the proctor know and make sure that you've got the time available in order to complete the exam, because unfortunately we won't be able to accept late exams. Now your scores on the exams will be used to determine your overall grade in the course.

And on the screen here, I've used a grading scheme that's very common in engineering management. I should note that the instructor reserves the right to modify the grading system, but in general, this is the system that will be used. For example, in order to get an A, you'll have to get 93% or higher. An A minus will be 90 to 92.9 and so on. Okay. So I do encourage you to familiarize yourself with that. And keep in mind, again, the main components of these grades, really the only components of these grades are the three exams that you'll be expected to complete on your own. One of the things that we mentioned in any course here at Old Dominion University is the notion of academic integrity. And really the key point is that you are all professionals or on your way to being so, and cheating is incompatible with that rule. I do ask that you familiarize yourself with the Old Dominion University honor code because it is in effect with for all student work submitted during this course. Really the key points as they apply to you, I think, are that it states that lying, cheating or plagiarism are violations of the honor system and will be subjected to disciplinary action. I should also explicitly note that using old exams from students who have previously had the course is prohibited and considered cheating.

Okay, so please make make sure that you are aware of that honor code and I trust that we won't have any problems in order to do well in this course. I think there's a number of keys to success, and I should note that, of course this isn't necessarily a comprehensive list, but I do think it helps illustrate the types of things you need in order to do well in this course. First and foremost, I think you need to watch each lecture. Okay. We've provided you with 30 lectures in this course, and each of them, I think, does add to your knowledge, and each of them does contain information that certainly is testable. So please make sure that you do watch each lecture. I know that it's tempting to skip ahead when you've got a whole bunch sitting in front of you, but please do take the time to go through each lecture in its entirety. Completing the homework to master tool building is another essential point. And as I said earlier on, the homework isn't going to be collected and it's not going to be graded. But it is absolutely essential in order to fully understand and appreciate how to apply the material that we've covered in the course. So please do make sure that you try to work those homework problems before reviewing the solutions. If you have questions, of course, I encourage you to seek out the instructor using the contact information provided in the syllabus.

You'll need to learn how to use a spreadsheet program. And if you haven't used a spreadsheet program before, that's okay. I will provide extensive help in how to use Excel throughout the course. There have been many examples provided in the course package that will give you some insight into how to use Excel. And I'm also going to go through many of those examples in class. Okay, so if you haven't used Excel before, I will hit on the key features as they are relevant to the material in this course. You'll need to learn to think critically about ambiguous situations. You'll see that in business. Of course, there are many gray areas and things aren't necessarily cut and dry and we will talk about that quite a bit throughout the course. But it is important that you recognize that you will need to learn to think critically about those types of scenarios and situations. Last but not least, please do your best to keep up with the reading. The textbook I think is excellent. It does provide a very good supplement to the material covered in the lectures, and I think it will aid in your understanding and your and help you to learn the material in this course. The next several slides are designed to help put the course into an overall context, so I'll just be providing a very brief course overview and of course more information is provided in the course syllabus and we'll learn a whole lot more about these topics as we work our way through the lectures.

But essentially this course focuses on basic accounting tools, engineering, economics and their role in the decision making processes of an organization. Our study of financial analysis is largely concerned with the interpretation of financial data prepared by accountants. So basically what we're going to do is we're going to learn how to perform a financial analysis on the standard documents of business, including the income statement, the balance sheet, the statement of cash flow and the statement of retained earnings. Our study of cost estimation, on the other hand, is largely concerned with the application of the capital budgeting techniques commonly used in engineering economics. So we'll look at tools like the internal rate of return, the net present value payback and others. So essentially what we're going to be doing is we're going to be looking at both the big picture, the firm level. That's where the accounting aspects come in and the financial analysis aspects come in. And we'll also be looking at the smaller picture, concerned primarily with project level decision making, and that's in large part where the engineering, economics or investment analysis comes into play. That being said, these functions are interdependent and that's something that I want to very heavily emphasize here at. May look as though we're going to study these things as though they are separate topics. But I want to emphasize that's certainly not the case.

And we will look at these things as being interrelated and we will try to take an integrated look at cost estimation and financial analysis in this course. One of the other things that I want to emphasize right at the start of the course is that I do recognize, of course, that many of you are not accountants and many of you are not financial managers as it stands now. But that's okay. Okay. Engineers don't require degrees in finance or accounting. But I do think that an understanding of the basic financial analysis and cost estimation techniques can really contribute to better analyses in engineering projects. Some of the major course topics that we're going to be covering. We'll talk a lot about the concept of social and commercial values. We'll spend quite a bit of time talking about the financial statements. And again, those will include the income statement, the balance sheet, the statement of cash flow and the statement of retained earnings. We'll spend some time talking about the time value of money, which is a very important concept that underlies much of the analysis we'll do in this course. We'll talk about capital budgeting, we'll talk about the valuation of stocks and bonds, risk ethics and of course, using financial information to guide decision making. Of course, this provides a very broad summary of the type of material that we're going to be covering in the course.

If you are looking for further details, you can consult the course outline and keep in mind that many of these topics, again, like the time value of money, risk, ethics and decision making are cross-cutting themes that will run throughout the course. So the fact that they may not be listed explicitly in each lecture in the course syllabus doesn't necessarily mean that these things won't pop up repeatedly. The other thing that I wanted to note as we are going through the early stages of the course overview is that this is a course about money and as we are going through the course, we're going to spend a lot of time talking about money because financial aspects of decision making do make a very or do play a very large role in the overall decision making process. That being said, however, it is important to reflect on the limits of money, and that's something that I'm going to ask you to do several times over the course of the material we cover here, and it is something that will come up several times throughout the course. Last but not least, in terms of the course overview, I just want to say a few words about why I learn this. If I haven't convinced you already that this may be some important material, first and foremost, you will work, you will likely be managed and you may manage others. And anybody who works in a commercial enterprise or basically any form of business, particularly those in management and engineering, I think will benefit from a strong understanding of the principles of financial analysis and cost estimation, because these really are critical components of any manager's job.

So even if you're not a manager, it's important to keep in mind that your manager will have these types of considerations in mind as they're going throughout their work day to day. And because of that, those considerations will ultimately filter down to you. Understanding reduces the sense of powerlessness. You may find that you want to do this kind of work, that you're very interested in this type of thing, and may seek out a position that focuses more on financial analysis and cost estimation. And if you do so, that would be great. However, you may also learn that you do not want to do this kind of work, and I think that that's an equally valid lesson as well. That being said, I think you'd still benefit from an understanding of the principles that we'll study in this course. But if you find that you're, you know, this isn't the material that most interests you, then perhaps it would make sense not to look for a position explicitly in financial analysis. You may find that you want to own or manage your own business. And I want to note that this course isn't explicitly dealing with managing your own business. But of course, many of the things that we cover in this course will help provide you with an understanding of the operation of a business from the financial perspective.

The last thing that I wanted to talk about in today's lecture is engineering, business and society. And again, this section is meant to help put the rest of the course into context. And I think it's important that to go through this material because I think that engineers really need to appreciate why they must understand business explicitly. The things that we're going to cover in this section include society's impact on engineering and business. We'll also talk very briefly about business and engineering's impact on society. We'll talk a little bit about regulation and standard setting. And then we'll spend some time talking about money and values. And as we're going through this, I think it would be very useful for you to keep in mind this overarching point mentioned in the in the box, and that is that business is not divorced from the rest of society and that we must always keep the big picture in mind. And really that's what the key message of this section is. And I will refer back to these types of points periodically throughout the rest of the course. So first, I wanted to spend a bit of time talking about society's impact on engineering and business and really the key point here is that all human activity takes place in a social setting, and that business must ultimately reflect the values of the society in which it operates.

Of course, business activities are the staff of life in many communities and are very much the concern of overall society. One of the ways that society demonstrates that concern is through regulation, and there are many examples of attempts to regulate. Some of them are successful. Some haven't been so successful not only recently, but throughout history as well. And here I've provided just a couple of illustrative examples. Of course, you'll probably be able to think of some on your own as well. We've seen guild restrictions, Luddites, railway unions. The Luddite example, for example, refers back to a tax on cotton mills in the early 1800s, when we had workers upset by wage reductions in the use of an apprentice workman that actually began to break into factories at night and destroy new machines that employers were using. So that's one way that certainly that society would have a large impact on business. More recent examples, antitrust legislation, which basically is concerned with the break up of concentrated power. And we also have protection for collective action by unions. Labor standards for the non unionized have also been created. So there are many ways, of course, in which society has a very large impact on business. And again, you would expect this given that all business has to operate within the society, that it exists, while society has a huge impact on business, the reverse is also true.

Business activities and engineering practice have an enormous impact on society. And again, I think you'll probably be able to come up with many examples on your own Here. I've provided just three illustrative examples to get you thinking about this topic. The first one that I have listed here is that the nature of the work, which is a critical element of human dignity, is defined in large part by technology and business practices. And of course, this is an area where engineers have a very large impact. Engineers often are directly involved in decisions and design, design and other considerations associated with technology and business practices. Another way where we can see the impact of business and engineering on society is status within society as a key human need. And in large part, business helps convey and create much of our status in modern society through both the nature of the work and relative reward patterns. And of course, I'm not saying that business is the only thing that helps convey our status within modern society, and certainly for some people it's more important than others, but it is important to keep that point in mind. The other point that I want to mention here, and this is one that I'll come back to a couple of times throughout the course, is that all businesses use common environmental sinks. Okay? So any business that is discharging emissions into the environment, whether it be emissions to the air emission, to emissions, to the water or emissions to the land, is directly impacting society through those emissions.

So there are many ways, again, in which business and engineering impact on society and these are just a couple of illustrative examples. Of course, if business is doing things that do not conform to accepted norms, society pushes back. And the way that they do that is in large part through regulation and standard setting Regulation is one of the key Western mechanisms for imposing social values on business. And this often involves setting a standard. And one of the reasons that society is expected to bear this role is that regulation usually cannot be done by industry. Okay? This is something that society has to do for business in general. There are three classes of regulation that you need to consider. One is to protect business from business. And an example of this basically is legislation against two tier pricing monopolies. So for instance, companies are prohibited from underpricing in areas where they have competition and over pricing where they have a monopoly. Another classification of regulation is protecting individuals from business. Another common example of this is labor law, and this is something that you can see in virtually every state in the United States and virtually every Western nation. Protecting society at large from business is another classification of regulation, and I think the best example. Well, this situation is environmental regulation, which, for example, might limit the amount of emissions that an organization or a business could discharge into the environment.

Whenever you have regulations, there's going to be two competing forces. On one side, you'll have people or business who are interested in streamlining them or reducing them for efficiency. And on the other side, you might have other groups that are interested in increasing regulations in order to increase effectiveness. Of course, history is full of imbalances in these two forces, and you should expect that these two competing forces will continue over the course of your career. So we've talked a little bit about society and values, and you may be wondering where money fits into all of this. And essentially money is the measure of commercial value. So questions like what is the value of a barrel of oil? What is the value of a pound of beef and what is the value of a riverfront piece of property are readily answered by money, and money has very good ability to measure commercial value. So although it does have some limitations in measuring some values, commercial values is not one of those areas where it does have too many limitations. As we're going through the course, we should keep in mind that the goal of business in most businesses at least, is to maximize commercial value, and most companies are in business to make money. We're going to talk a little bit more about the goal of the firm later on in the course, and we will come back to that point in later lectures.

While money is an excellent measure of commercial value, many other values cannot be measured by money. Okay. And questions here are just again illustrative might include what is the value of wilderness? What is the value of privacy? And these questions aren't so easily answered by dollar figures. That's not to say that there aren't efforts to try to develop models to determine the value of wilderness. But generally speaking, these types of values, it is very difficult to put a monetary value on it. With that in mind, we should always remember that business does take place in a social framework, and society's role in this case is in large part to help assess competing values. So that comes back to the point again that values are set by society and then business has to operate within those constraints set by society. This is again something that you will likely bump into throughout the course of your career and should be kept in mind as you move into your careers in engineering and engineering management. Of course, addressing these issues is not easy and there's no formula to follow. So we don't have any formula where we can plug a bunch of variables in and get a nice, neat answer that tells us exactly what we should do. Of course, pitfalls do arise on either side of the balance. On one side, we can see that business cannot consistently set standards on its own, particularly on international issues.

Businesses tend to be focused very heavily on the types of things that they do and may not take that very broad picture that would be needed in order to set standards again, particularly on issues that move across state or national borders, professional citizens can distort the process. Okay. There's a lot of special interest groups in society today, and it's important to remember that they don't always speak for society as a whole. And in fact, sometimes they don't always speak for all of their membership as a whole. So that's another important point that we should keep in mind. And of course, targets of social action often change. For instance, in the 1980s, acid rain was a very important issue. And I'm not going I'm not saying that it's not important now. It certainly is. But we do tend to focus more on our focus on these types of issues does tend to shift over time. Some illustrative examples of non monetary issues facing us today include the uneven distribution of income, climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions is a particularly high profile issue over the last several years preservation of diversity of life on the planet. And of course you may be able to come up with other examples on your own. Another one that jumps out at me is human rights organizations are increasingly looking for ways to address non monetary issues, and there are very many progressive organizations out there that are are trying to build these these types of considerations into their decision making process.

One manifestation of this trend is the increasing trend towards triple bottom line reporting and essentially what triple bottom line reporting frameworks do is divide the measurement of a company's progress into three areas economic performance, environmental performance and social performance. Now, different companies may split these areas slightly differently, and they may interpret these types of things differently. But the main point is that companies are increasingly looking to take into account factors other than financial factors. So here, of course, we have that focus on economic performance, and that should always remain one of the key, key issues in any organization. Otherwise, they're unlikely to stay in business for very long. But many companies are increasingly looking at how they're impacting the environment and society as a whole, trying to build those types of considerations into their into their business making decision models. These types of issues are increasingly discussed in annual reports. However, I do want to note that models for reporting on triple bottom line issues, particularly social and environmental. Issues are relatively early stages of development and we should expect to see more development in these areas over the coming years. Summing up some of the key points that I've been talking about here today. Of course, social values will change over time and organizations must adapt to these changes.

The one that do this the fastest will gain a competitive advantage. And of course, because organizations, because engineers generally work in organizations, we have to listen very carefully to societal concerns to make sure that we're responsive to those concerns and make sure that our organizations ultimately reflect society's values in our actions over the long term. So some of the key points from today's from this first lecture, at least as it pertains to engineering, business and society, the purpose of society is basically to maximize social values. The purpose of business is to maximize commercial values as measured by money within social constraints. As we've discussed throughout the lecture, practically, there is a great deal of judgment and latitude in each. But always keep in mind that social concerns will always be the overarching framework in which business and management activities take place. So that's all I wanted to say for the first lecture here today. Again, today we talked a little bit about the syllabus and the course overview and if you're looking for more information on the course in general, I do encourage you to consult the course syllabus because it does provide some detail on the material that we'll be covering and tells you exactly when you can expect to come across it in terms of the lectures. And we also spent some time talking about engineering, business and society to try to help put the rest of the course in context. And that's it for the first lecture.",6473,"[-0.00395675 -0.01791609  0.00560291 ... -0.0201242   0.00311548

Business Ethics,2.0,CEFA,"Title: Business Ethics; Description: In this lecture on business ethics, the instructor emphasizes the importance of ethical decision making in the business world. They define ethics as a set of principles that govern conduct, highlighting the need for engineers to uphold ethical standards in their profession. The instructor discusses the challenges in maintaining ethical standards, such as loopholes, cultural norms, and pressures to exceed expectations. They also explore rationalizations for unethical behavior. 
The lecture introduces a classification scheme for ethical decisions, categorizing them as immoral management, amoral management, and moral management. The instructor warns against engaging in immoral management and highlights the need to consider the ethical implications of strictly legal decisions.
The video stresses that moral management is the desired approach for acting ethically in business. Following the letter and spirit of the law is crucial in moral management. Ethical behavior has a positive impact on businesses, leading to reduced litigation costs, a positive corporate image, increased shareholder confidence, and loyalty from stakeholders. On the other hand, unethical behavior can have negative consequences, including a decrease in a company's share price and eventual exposure of cover-ups.
The lecture emphasizes that ethics should inform every decision in engineering management and that laws should serve as a guide in determining right and wrong actions. Familiarity with ethical standards for engineers and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is important in practicing engineering and financial decision-making within a company. Ignorance of the law is not an excuse, so being aware of profession-specific ethical standards and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is crucial.
The video also provides key information about the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. It imposes social values on businesses, expecting executives to behave ethically and protect investments and the environment. The act includes various components such as real-time disclosures, transparency requirements, and strengthened criminal penalties. It aims to restore public confidence in capital markets and enhance corporate governance.
Overall, the video emphasizes the importance of ethics in business decision making and provides an understanding of different ethical classifications for managers. It highlights the need for moral management and the consequences of unethical behavior. Students are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the information presented as business ethics will continue to be discussed throughout the course.; Transcript: Greetings. Hello again. In this lecture, we'll be discussing business ethics. And this is a very important topic. That is one of the underlying themes throughout this course. So this is something that I'm going to discuss periodically throughout the lectures in the remainder of the class. Jumping over to the slides in terms of the material that we're going to cover specifically today, we'll start off by discussing business ethics in general and understanding what that means. We'll talk a little bit about the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and then we'll talk a little bit about an ethical action test, which will basically give you some questions and ideas to help guide you in making ethical decisions. Getting right into it, then I think that when we talk about ethics, often the first thing that springs to mind is headlines like these. And I think that these headlines have become all too familiar over the last couple of years and something that has become very high profile in business. So while headlines like those do provide reminders of what not to do, it is it's very important, however, to talk about what ethics is and what does constitute acceptable behavior in terms of defining ethics. Basically, it can be looked at in a number of different ways. One is to look at it as a set of principles of right conduct and notice that right is in quotation mark, because what one person considers right is not always necessarily going to be the same thing as another person, a theory or system of moral values, or the rules or standards governing the conduct of a person or the conduct of members of of a profession.

And in engineering, of course, all engineers are expected to uphold certain ethical standards if they want to practice engineering. Stated another way ethics basically provide the basic rules or parameters for conducting any activity in an acceptable manner. So by ethics, essentially what we mean is doing what's right, fair, honest and legal. And one of the reasons we spend so much time on this beyond being the right thing to do, is that ethical violations attract widespread publicity, and negative publicity often creates severe negative impacts on a firm. So this is something that we need to pay attention to in all of our decision making. That being said, there are, of course, a number of issues in maintaining ethical standards, and this list is illustrative rather than comprehensive, and it's just meant to get you thinking about these types of topics again. You may be able to think of more issues on your own. First and foremost, I think we have loopholes, and whenever you define something, someone will always look for a loophole. And one of the ways to guard against this is to focus on principles rather than standards. And really, when you're talking about laws, to focus more on the spirit of the law rather than the letter of the law.

Another issue that we have in maintaining ethical standards are semantics. And this is basically, again, whenever you try to define something, you get into the use and interrelationships of words, phrases and sentences that different people may interpret different ways, cultural norms. It's very important to remember that different cultures have different sets of expectations. And as we talked about in a previous lecture, society's expectations do play a very large role in determining what is acceptable in business. Another issue that we may have in maintaining ethical standards is leaders who are not watchful or are tolerant of ethical lapses. And the last point that we have here is the pressure to achieve the unachievable. People may feel that it is necessary to bend the rules in order to exceed. So building on that slide, we can see what some of the rationalizations for unethical behavior might be. And again, this is an illustrative list. Some of the rationalizations might include that the activity is not really illegal or immoral, that it's in the individual's or the corporation's best interests. And therefore, the corporation may think that it's okay that they'll never be found out, or that if it helps the company, the company will condone it. So these might provide some rationalizations for why people may make unethical decisions. Whenever you're talking about ethics, I think it's very useful or one of the things that I've always found very useful in thinking about ethics is this method of classifying decisions displayed here on the screen, and you'll see that quadrants one and quadrants four are fairly clear.

Okay? Quadrant one you can see is when we have something that is ethical and legal, that's clearly, clearly where we want to be at all times and ethical. Four Presents examples where you have something that is unethical and illegal. For instance, something like embezzlement. And very clearly that's an area that you want to stay out of. However, one of the good things about this, about this slide, about this classification scheme, is I think that it does highlight that sometimes there is a little bit of gray area and sometimes it is a little bit more ambiguous in determining what is the right thing to do. For example, in Quadrant two, you could have situations where you have a scenario where something is ethical but illegal. And I think a very prominent example of this would be the underground railway in Quadrant three. You can see you have examples where something might be unethical, but technically legal. Okay, So for example, you find some money laying on the street and maybe it's yours, but is it really the right thing to do to keep that money? So what this table, I think, really helps highlight is that sometimes it is tough to know what is the right thing to do.

And in order to help provide some more guidance in thinking about ethics and identifying what's right and what's not, there's three. Common classifications and managerial ethics that are typically used. And I'm going to spend just a few minutes talking about these over the next several slides. They are immoral management. Amoral management and moral management. And you'll see that each of the next three slides are actually organized using the same format. So each of these slides says a few words about ethical norms, motives, goals, orientation to the law, and possible strategies in this particular form of management. So first and foremost, let's take a look at immoral management. And this basically gives us an example of what not to do. Immoral management is clearly unethical. So in this case, we might have norms such as positive and active opposition to what is moral and ethical decisions that run counter to accepted ethical principles or act active negation of moral conduct. Again, these are clearly things that we would want to stay away from in business motives. Of course, different people will have different motives. One might be selfishness. A goal may be profit at any price orientation. To launder this type of scenario, you might perceive to be laws or barriers to overcome executing a strategy of cut corners and exploit. And again, different people may have different motives or goals or different strategies, but I think it does convey the idea that essentially this is something that we want to stay away from.

Immoral management is where things get a little bit more fuzzy. And this is one of those blurry ethical areas. But as we're going through this, I think the fact that something is okay in a strictly legal sense does not necessarily mean it's ethical. And that might be the take home message from from this slide. And if we're referring back to the slide, a couple of or the table a couple of slides ago in terms of classifying decisions, I think looking at quadrants two and three would apply pretty well in this scenario. Under this particular scenario, ethical norms might include that management is neither moral or immoral. Decisions are not necessarily based on moral judgment, and managerial activity is outside or beyond any particular moral code. Motives in this case may be well intentioned, but still selfish. We're not considering all stakeholders, and we're going to talk a little bit more about stakeholders in a later lecture. The goal here might be profitability. Okay, that sure seems like a good goal, but as we'll discuss later on in the course, profitability is actually not the overall goal of the firm. The overall goal of the firm is wealth maximization and there is a difference between profitability and wealth maximization that we will discuss in a future lecture.

Orientation to the law under this scenario might be to follow the letter of the law. And as you'll see on the next slide, this is a little bit different from what we might consider a more ethical position, which looks beyond the letter of the law and actually goes towards the spirit of the law. In terms of the strategy, this may be more of a laissez faire type approach where we react to legal issues rather than taking a proactive stance. Moral management As you look through this slide, you may note that this is clearly what we want to be. Of course, it's not always easy, but this does provide some guidance into the types of behavior that we do want to follow in order to act ethically within business. Some norms under this case, managers conform to a standard of ethical or right behavior, and two, accepted professional standards and conduct. And again, for engineers, this is something that's particularly relevant because we do have defined ethical standards that all engineers practicing in the United States are expected to follow. Motives succeed only within the law and ethical constraints, fairness, justice and due process profitability. Only while engaging in ethical conduct might be one of the goals under a moral management type of approach orientation to the law. And I think this is one of the key things that really distinguishes moral management is following the letter and the spirit of the law.

Here we've got an bolded because that's a very important principle in terms of defining moral management, at least as it's defined in classified in many of the books published strategy here to establish and propagate sound legal and ethical standards and to show leadership when dilemmas arise, as they inevitably will. Beyond altruism, there is a very strong business case for behaving ethically. Ethical organizations generally have fewer litigation and judgment. Costs generally have a more positive corporate image than organizations that have had severely negative publicity resulting from ethical missteps. Ethical organizations may instill increased shareholder confidence, and they may also enjoy greater loyalty and respect from their stakeholders than organizations that once again have had very high profile ethical missteps. The ethical environment in a company also has a direct influence on the company's share price. This is often delayed, but this is something that we see very explicitly. Whenever very high profile, negative ethical cases come to light, you'll often see that a company's share price will drop quite substantially. The other thing that we need to keep in mind in in terms of these ethical missteps is that cover ups will eventually be exposed. And ultimately, although the impact of positive ethics is delayed, it ultimately will have a negative impact. If the officers of the company have not been behaving in an ethical manner. When we look at engineering ethics.

Pardon me and. Engineering management. You can see that ethics really must inform every decision throughout the entire organization, and it pops up everywhere in engineering management. So there's possibilities for missteps at every turn, whether you're looking at planning or requirements, analysis, budgeting, forecasting, monitoring, interpersonal relationships, communication, reporting, process improvement. There's all kinds of possibilities for ethical missteps in engineering management. And one of the things that we need to keep in mind when we're thinking about ethics and engineering management is that the organization is only going to be as strong as its weakest link. So all it takes is an ethical misstep at one particular part of the project, and that can have negative impacts for the project as a whole or the company as a whole. So it's very important that we build ethics into every step of the decision making process. So some of the take home messages from those previous slides in terms of determining what is right is first and foremost to let laws be your guide. If you're looking for a place to start. Well, laws are is a good one. There are different types of laws that you can consider. One is the everybody ought to know laws. Okay. Laws like would my mother be proud of me doing this? Okay. And again, different people may have different laws or codes in this particular area, but basically this gets back to accepted norms within society, industry or profession specific.

And in engineering, we are lucky enough to have very defined ethical standards to which we are expected to adhere. So please do familiarize yourself with those if you are practicing engineering in the United States or elsewhere, and if you need further guidance. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act is another very good place to start. We're going to spend a few minutes talking about that over the next few slides. Again, when we are looking at laws, it is important that we look to the intention behind the actual words and provisions. And another point that I want to really strongly emphasize is that ignorance of the law is not an excuse. Okay? So just as if you're driving 100 miles an hour and a 100 kilometer zone in another country, you're still going to get a speeding ticket. You can't claim that you didn't know about a particular law as a defense. So ignorance of the law is not an excuse. And because of that, it's very important that you familiarize yourself with the profession, specific ethical standards in engineering. And if you are an officer of a company, if you're involved in financial decision making within a company, I think it's also very important that you familiarize yourself with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which we're going to spend a few minutes talking about. Now, just to give you a bit of history on how the Sarbanes-Oxley Act came about.

Of course, as we talked about towards the beginning of this lecture, there have been a number of very high profile scandals over the last several years within the United States and elsewhere as well, that have reduced confidence in business leadership. So to help address this in the United States and I first I want to note that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act only applies to the United States. The US Congress passed this act in 2002, and basically what it did is it radically altered the financial reporting and responsibility of corporate officials. We'll talk about that a little bit over the next couple of slides. Some of the goals in bringing Sox into being. And when I say Sox, I'm referring to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to restore public confidence in capital markets, to enhance corporate governance. And you'll see that this is one of the things that Sox, I think, spends a lot of effort doing force greater accountability on officers and executives by establishing explicit personal liability for reporting accuracy. So CEOs and CFOs, chief executive officers and chief financial officers are actually responsible for ensuring that the information they present to the public is as accurate as can possibly be. Another one of the goals of Sox was to revise and strengthen the external audit process, creating systematic processes designed to prevent, detect, investigate and remediate fraud and misconduct. Or also another one of the very major goals of Sox.

As you're looking through this list, you'll probably see that the benefits and goals are. I've tend to frame in business terms, but it's also important to remember that Sox, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, is all about imposing social values on business. Okay? Basically, society expects executives to behave ethically because it protects their investment, their environment and adheres to generally accepted values. Just to provide you with a brief overview, of course, I'm not going to go through the entire act line by line. And if you are interested in learning more about the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, you can access that on the Internet. Some key elements include real time disclosures. Okay. So one of the requirements of Sox, for instance, is that each firm must disclose on a very timely basis any additional information about the firm's financial condition. Okay. So if if things look like they're going to be changing, that needs to be disclosed. Officer certification, As I mentioned in a previous slide, CEOs and CFOs must certify each periodic report containing financial statements to basically say that this confirms with the Securities Exchange Act, which was brought into being in 1934, and also very importantly, to certify that the information fairly. Presents the company's financial condition and the results of its operations. If officers of the company, of CEOs or CFOs knowingly or willingly certify information they know to be false and the penalties can be fairly severe, including very high monetary fines and can also include significant jail terms.

Increasing transparency and independence required by the law are also, of course, key elements of Sox new audit committee requirements was another very important element introduced into Sox. And basically what it does is it states that any audit committee must consist solely of independent directors. Loans and certain trades have been prohibited, prohibited explicitly in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, for example, no publicly traded firm may make any personal loan to its executive officers or directors, with very limited exceptions. And last but not least, you can see that we have a mandated SEC and SEC is the Securities and Exchange Commission review and some additional provisions in Sox that talk about the new powers for the SEC are summarized here on this slide. One is that it created a new public company, Accounting Oversight Board. Criminal penalties for white collar crimes were strengthened. And as I mentioned on the previous slide, one illustration of this is that if officers of a company knowingly certified information, they know to be false, they can be punished or punished very severely. Statutes of limitations have been changed. New analyst conflicts of interest rules and protection for whistleblowers has been strengthened in Sox as well. Some likely consequences of Sox include more management and executive attention to financial details. Of course, if CEOs and CFOs can go to prison or be fined for knowingly certifying information, that is false, you would think that they're going to spend more time reviewing that information and making sure that it is accurate as can possibly be more conservative.

Company reporting is also is also a likely consequence of Sox more reporting, realism and transparency. Higher compliance costs. Okay. We have, for instance, more stringent reporting requirements. We have more stringent auditing requirements. Those, too, come with costs, confusion over the appropriate level of details and different definition of compliance. This is something that typically happens when any new law is introduced. There's always going to be some confusion on definitions and exactly what it means in practice. And one other consequence or potential consequence of Sox, of course, is increased litigation. One of the points that I do want to make when we're talking about Sox is of course the fact that it is not it does not eliminate potential for missteps. Okay. So the fact that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has been put into place doesn't mean that ethical missteps are going to completely disappear. What it does essentially is help provide further guidance on what constitutes accepted ethical behavior in business by CEOs and CFOs. And it also introduces or very explicitly notes the consequences associated with violating those ethical standards. So what does all this mean? Although there is no clear answer, I think that some of these questions may help guide the way and might help provide some insight into the types of things that you should ask yourself when you're presented with an ethical dilemma.

Is it legal? Certainly, if something is illegal, you probably don't want to be doing it because it's going to be a bad thing in the long run. Does the action unfairly single out an individual or group? Does the action affect the morals or legal rights of any individual or group? Does it confirm? Does the action conform? Pardon me, to accepted moral standards? And again, this goes back to making sure that you can place your actions in that overall societal context and make sure that you're behaving in accordance with accepted or generally accepted social norms. Are there alternative courses of action that are less likely to cause actual or potential harm? Does it comply with our rules and guidelines? So if a company has gone to the trouble of establishing policies and principles and rules and guidelines, it probably makes a lot of sense to follow those. And you can use those as one of your guiding lights if need be. Will be comfortable and guilt free if I do it. This is one of the things that always sticks out for me personally. Does it match our stated commitments? Again, going back to those commitments, making sure that you are taking them into consideration in your decision making with the most ethical person I know, do it. Okay.

Other questions that might be useful. Would I do it to my family or friends? Would I feel if okay, if if someone did it to me and would I mind reading about it in the local newspaper? As we talked about earlier on, cover ups are eventually exposed and ethical missteps do tend to generate very large headlines in newspapers. So bringing all this together, summarizing some key points here in terms of a holistic approach to ethics in business decision making, hire the right people, set standards more than rules. And the most important principle is to let your ethical example at all times be absolutely impeccable. And these things, of course, are easier said than done. And there is no hard and fast rules that I can give you in order to make sure that decisions that you take are within lines of generally accepted ethical principles. But hopefully this lecture did give you some insight into some of the considerations that you need to keep in mind. So again, many of these topics will come up throughout the rest of the course. I will periodically discuss business ethics as it is appropriate throughout the remainder of the of the course and many of the future lectures. And I do encourage you to review this information, make sure that you are familiar with it, because as we all know, ethical considerations are very important in business and very important in engineering.",4952,"[-0.00106262 -0.02680325  0.01023059 ... -0.01938495  0.01574627

Introduction to Accounting,3.1,CEFA,"Title: Introduction to Accounting; Description: In this video, students will learn about the importance of understanding accounting to provide context for studying financial statements. They will be introduced to the different financial statements, including the income statement, statement of retained earnings, balance sheet, and statement of cash flow. The video emphasizes the relevance of bookkeeping and basic accounting concepts in the field of engineering management. Students will understand that each financial statement contains different information, and it is crucial to analyze them all. The video poses three key questions that financial statements answer: how to make and keep money, how much money is available and where it came from, and where the money was spent. The video highlights that financial statements are part of a chain that includes bookkeeping, accounting, and analysis in action. While being an accountant is not necessary, the video emphasizes that all managers, including engineering managers, need to be able to do intelligent financial analysis. The video provides an overview of bookkeeping, focusing on its role in generating information for financial statements. Journals are explained as chronological records of transactions, also known as the books of original entry. Double-entry bookkeeping is introduced, explaining the concept of offsetting credits and debits. The video explains that debits represent increases in asset accounts, while credits represent increases in liability accounts. The instructor stresses that understanding these concepts is vital for effectively reading and analyzing financial statements. Additionally, the video mentions the importance of accuracy in capturing financial transactions in journals and ledgers, as errors in this process can lead to incorrect financial statements. Auditing is discussed as a tool for reviewing and ensuring the accuracy and consistency of financial reporting, although it does not guarantee fraud protection. The video concludes by highlighting materiality and reliability as important accounting concepts that govern adjustments and corrections. Overall, this video provides students with a basic understanding of debits and credits, the bookkeeping process, and the significance of accurate financial data for analyzing and making informed decisions based on financial statements.; Transcript: Greetings. In this lecture, we're going to cover an introduction to accounting. And this is an important topic because it helps provide some context for our study of the financial statements that will make up the content of much of the next several lectures. What we're going to do today is, of course highlighted in the session overview and you have a copy of that in your course slides. We're going to start off by providing just a very brief overview of the financial statements. So we'll talk a little bit about the income statement, the statement of retained earnings, the balance sheet and the statement of cash flow. We're not going to get into a lot of detail on those. In fact, as you'll see by looking at the course syllabus, each of those topics makes up its own lecture. Okay. So we're just going to provide a very brief overview of those statements. We'll talk a little bit about bookkeeping and basic accounting concepts, and then we'll talk very briefly about operational versus financial management, which is something that we're going to return to periodically throughout the course. As I've discussed several times already throughout the throughout earlier lectures, I do recognize that many of you may not have been exposed to accounting previously, and that's okay. Try not to worry if you haven't done this stuff before. The reason we're doing this, however, is that I believe the practice of engineering management is much easier if one has some understanding of basic accounting principles.

Again, financial management is something that all engineering managers need to be familiar with, at least in passing at an absolute minimum, and hopefully with some greater level of knowledge ideally. And the reason for this is it'll make the practice of engineering management much easier. So getting into it then, financial statements are the ubiquitous drawings of business. Okay, these are two business. What a process and instrumentation diagram is to a chemical engineer. An assembly drawing is to a mechanical engineer or a flowchart is to an industrial engineer. So the point of these examples, of these illustrative examples is to help us understand that you cannot understand business if you can't read these. Okay? So just as you cannot be an effective electrical engineer, if you can't read a circuit drawing or a single line drawing, you can't be an effective manager if you can't read financial statements. Okay, It's taken as a given. Then anybody involved in management is capable of extracting useful information from the financial statements. Financial statements apply to all sizes of business from the single proprietor corner store to a multinational company. And for this reason, again, it's very important that all managers are able to understand these because no matter what business you're in, you're going to have to work with the income statement, the balance sheet, the statement of cash flow and the statement of retained earnings and using those statements to extract useful information. Of course, many financial statements are public information and available on the Internet.

Publicly traded companies are required to share their financial statements with the public. Private companies, of course, don't necessarily have to share that information if they choose not to. That being said, financial statements are the standard documents of business and everyone uses them. And because of that, it's very important that we know how to extract useful information from the data. Financial statements Answer three key questions. The first is how should we make and how much do we keep? These questions are answered by the income statement and the statement of retained earnings. It's important to note that the statement of retained earnings is often combined with the income statement, though technically it is its own separate statement. It's often combined with the income statement because it is so brief, and that's something that we'll see in a future lecture when we talk about the income statement. The second key question that financial statements answer is how much do we have and where did the money come from to get it? These questions are answered by the balance sheet. So the first thing that you may see by looking at those first two questions is that different financial statements contain different information. Okay? So looking at one of them is not enough to get a good picture of how the business is doing from a financial perspective, you need to look at them all, okay, because they do contain different information that is particularly important to running a business.

The third key question Where did our money go is answered by the statement of cash flow. And this statement basically takes into account key information from the other statements from the income statement, the statement of retained earnings and the balance sheet. Give us an idea to what happened to our cash over a particular period of time. Financial statements are a part of a chain. Okay. So in order to generate them, it is important to understand, you know, this chain bookkeeping is the first point in the chain, the first link in the chain accounting. Then we get to the financial statements and finally analysis in action. Our focus in this course is on analysis and action of financial statements. And that's something that you'll see once we get into the lectures focusing on the financial statements. But it still is important to understand this chain, to understand where the information comes from in the financial statements that we analyze and that we ultimately use to guide our action. The purpose of the chain is to turn data into information, into action. And again, the purpose of financial analysis is to guide action. And that's the reason why we do all of this analysis to help us manage the business better. As I've discussed earlier emphatically, you do not need to be an accountant to understand financial statements or to do intelligent financial analysis. Equally, however, you cannot be an effective manager if you cannot do analysis of financial statements.

So again, these are things that all managers. Regardless of their function within a firm, including engineering managers need to be able to read, although bookkeeping and basic accounting concepts are going to be very briefly reviewed in today's lecture, the focus in this course is on understanding and analyzing financial statements. But that being said, I think it is useful to go through bookkeeping because it does help us to understand how we generate the information that goes into the financial statements that ultimately we learn how to read. So bookkeeping in any significantly sized company, of course, numerous transactions take place every day and these transactions should generate a paper trail. Whether these this paper trail is through receipts or purchase orders. The point is that whenever a company makes a transaction, there's some sort of paper that's generated, there's some sort of record of that transaction of that transaction that is generated. And what bookkeeping does is essentially take that vast, that humongous paper trail, that raw data and put it into what we call a first level of categorization, a journal. So it takes all of that information and tries to put it into some usable format that we can ultimately use to generate the financial statements and to do an analysis in action to see how we can improve our business. Journals are chronological and by subject area. They're often referred to as the books of original entry. And in fact, it may be useful to think of a journal as a diary because again, it does provide essentially this history of all the transactions within the company.

All journals are double entry, and double entry means that basically at least two accounts are affected by each transaction. And we're going to talk a little bit about this notion of double entry over the next couple of slides. And the key component that you need to understand, the key concept that you need to understand from this double entry perspective is that each transaction has offsetting credits and or debits. Now you may have heard of debits and credits before, but I think it is useful to take a moment to clarify what we mean by them. It's not going to be the focus in this course. We're not going to spend a lot of time looking at debits and credits, but I think it does provide a useful theoretical basis and at least something for your own knowledge so that you can discuss these things intelligently. Essentially, a debit is an increase in any asset account. Okay? And an asset account includes things like cash, inventory and receivables. We're going to spend more time talking about asset accounts, particularly when we look at the balance sheet. A debit is also a decrease in any liability account, okay, which includes shareholder equity. So that could be things like accounts payable, taxes, long term debt. And again, we're going to talk more about assets and liabilities later on. But the key point to understand is that a debit is an increase in an asset account and a decrease in a liability account.

A credit is the exact opposite. So a credit is an increase in an asset account or pardon me, a decrease in an asset account and an increase in a liability account. Okay. So although you don't need to understand all the details of debits and credits for the purposes of this course or to do an intelligent analysis of financial statements, I did want to spend just a moment demonstrating these concepts through a very basic example to give you some insight into this concept of double entry and debits and credits. So let's say, for example, that I put $100,000 into a business at start up. Okay, so we have 100 K, the K refers to 1000. Okay. So if I put $100,000 into a business at start up, the cash in the business goes up by $100,000. And this is a debit. Okay? Remember, a debit is an increase in an asset account. Okay. And that's just on the previous slide if you're looking for a reference point. Okay. So the cash in the business goes up by $100,000. That's a debit. And the shareholders equity account also goes up by $100,000. And that's a credit. And the reason for that is that the shareholders equity account is what we referred to as a liability. Okay? And when we have an increase in a liability, we have a credit. Again, we're going to spend more time looking at that later on.

If I borrow $40,000 and use an additional $25,000 of cash to buy a packaging machine, my fixed assets equipment account increases by $65,000. And again, this is a debit because we're having an increase in an asset account and I have two offsetting credits. One is a bank loan of $40,000 and the other is a reduction of cash of $25,000. Finally, if a customer pays me for goods received 30 days ago, then the cash goes up and receivables goes down by the same amount. Now you need to know this exists, but you don't need to master It is the point highlighted in the box. And really what I want to emphasize is that the point is not to teach accounting, but rather to illustrate the concept of offsetting entries in this example. Okay, so the details of this are not necessarily relevant to understanding financial statements, but anyone looking at the financial statements of a real business needs to understand that they are built up from numerous small transactions to which rigorous accounting rules have been applied. And really, that's what I want you to understand. I'm not going to test you on debits and credits and doing these types of analyses. The key point is, again, to recognize that just like an energy balance in thermodynamics, this is a way to ensure the correctness of tracking monetary changes in an organization. Now, assets and liabilities are recorded in accounts and accounts are created to reflect each business and involves managerial judgment.

So it is important to note that different organizations will have different accounts. So it's not consistent from organization to organization, but you should be consistent internally so that you can evaluate the information intelligently over a period of time. Of course, too many accounts equals no information from data overload. And at the same time, too few means that we can't see where problems are arising. So there is this give and take in terms of the number of accounts that each business will create. But again, it does involve managerial judgment. Some examples of accounts, again, could include cash or assets, liabilities. Stockholders equity at the top level. Within each of those will be several components under assets. For example, you might have cash receivables and inventory, so each transaction is then recorded in a journal. Some examples of this could be cash receipts, sales, cash disbursements, purchases. You may have monthly transactions, payroll, general, all kinds of different transactions could potentially take place. But the key point again is that each of these transactions need to be captured in the journal so that we can begin to build that database with which we'll ultimately construct the financial statements that we learn to read and that we learn to analyze and that we ultimately take action on. So the bookkeeping process journal entries are transferred to ledgers. Okay. So remember, we start with this raw data. We have transactions which yield receipts which yield purchase orders.

These are captured and put into journals. Journal entries are then ultimately transferred to what we call a ledger, and ledgers are posted to accounts which we call the Book of Finance Final Entry. Remember, journals were referred to as the book of original entry. Ledgers are the next step, and these are referred to as the Book of Final Entry. There are five types of accounts which again have subsets assets, liabilities, stockholders, equity revenues and expenses are the five types of accounts. And again, each one of these could have subsets. Debits are separated from credits at this stage, each being put into the appropriate account and the sum of all accounts should balance since every credit has an offsetting debit. Typically ledgers are done are done on a periodic basis. Normally it's on a monthly basis. But again, different companies may have different processes. They may wait to do it on a quarterly basis, but in general they are done on a monthly basis. Finally, ledgers are assembled into the standard financial statements. Okay, so we have this chain of transactions which generate documentation which are then put into a journal which are then posted to a ledger. Finally, we get to the financial statements and these again are the financial statements that we learn to read in this course. So although it's not our focus, I just very briefly wanted to go through that bookkeeping process to help illustrate how important it is and to help further underline that concept, to help further underline that point, to understand how important capturing financial data is, consider the army of people in any company who does this.

Okay, Typically there's a whole bunch of people associated with capturing those financial transactions and making sure that there are no mistakes in the process to capture those. And again, it's very important that there are no mistakes at the Journal or Ledger phase, because ultimately those mistakes will make their way into the financial statements and may guide us incorrectly once we do that analysis and action. So it's important to make sure we capture this information properly. It's so important that companies actually hire auditing firms to review their practices, to go over their books and make sure that things have been captured properly and that things have been presented fairly. Okay. So auditing helps ensure that companies report their data consistently, consistently and fully. But it is important to note that auditing does not insure against fraud. Okay, So yes, auditing is a very useful tool to help check how the company is doing, but it's not necessarily a guarantee. Okay. It can't state with 100% certainty that everything is done properly because by definition, any audit is going to be only a sample, only some basic accounting concepts. Again, that I'd like you to keep in mind, accounting is the major means of organizing and summarizing information about economic activities, some basic accounting concepts to keep in mind as we are going throughout the course are materiality and reliability, and they're defined here on the screen.

Essentially, materiality governs adjustments and corrections. Okay, So it tells us whether or not we need to go back and fix any small errors that we may have made. Okay. So an item is material, if it's omission or misstatement, would mislead the reader of the financial statement under consideration. So if you're $1 billion company and you accidentally forget to include a box of erasers in your books, that's not necessarily material, okay? The erasers might cost a dollar, so you may not go back and correct that individually. Instead, you would make an adjustment at the end of the period. If, however, you're a $50,000 company and you forgot to include the $40,000 in salaries you paid out, then you'd certainly have to go back and make that adjustment because that would be considered material. Reliability is the quality of information that assures decision making. That the information captures the conditions or events it purports to represent. So one of the keys in going through the bookkeeping and accounting processes is to make sure that you accurately capture the information and that you fairly represent it. Okay. So that's that's essentially what we mean by reliability. What accounting does at the end of the day is basically take the accounts and consistently display the results in a standard format. Now, I do want to emphasize that there is not consistency between companies even in the same industry.

Okay? Again, different companies will choose different accounts to suit their own needs. So different companies may track information slightly differently. What's most important is that the companies are consistent internally in how they do that, because if they don't be consistent internally, then it's virtually impossible to judge management's effectiveness in running the business. Okay. If you're constantly changing accounts and constantly changing the definitions of those accounts, it's very difficult to track what happens. And remember, the entire point of preparing these financial statements is to guide action and analysis. And if you can't interpret the statements because you don't know what the numbers mean, then they become significantly less useful. So we go through that process of bookkeeping and accounting, and ultimately we have four standard financial or standard documents that emerge. Those are the income statement, the statement of retained earnings, the balance sheet, the statement of cash flow. And these are the statements that we learn to read. One of the things that I did want to note is that these documents are not always called the same thing by different people. For example, the statement of earnings is an alternate to the income statement that's commonly used, and the statement of changes in financial position is a common alternate to the balance sheet. Okay. Also, keep in mind that there are minor differences in the actual format of the statements, and we're going to talk about that a little bit later on when we get into each of the individual statements.

Again, what's most important is that the company is consistent from year to year internally and how it reports externally. As I've mentioned before, the income statement and the statement of retained earnings are often combined and year to year consistency is crucial. Standard format is not as crucial. Again, there will be minor differences in how companies track accounts and how companies ultimately present that information. When it gets to the point of being in an income statement, balance sheet or statement of cash flow or a statement of retained earnings, the statements that we study provide information on both the operational and financial management of the company. Operational management is mainly concerned with the major day to day activities that generate revenues and expenses. This is tracked in large part by the income statement. Financial management, on the other hand, is mainly concerned with where to get cash and how to use cash for the benefit of the entity. This is tracked in large part by the balance sheet. And so again, keep in mind that the standard financial documents we look at have different purposes and because of that, we need to learn how to read all of them. Another key point that I wanted to talk about very briefly before we close off this lecture is that money does come in two different forms. One is debt, the other is equity debt is essentially someone else's money. This is when a company borrows money from a bank, for instance, and this needs to be repaid according to a predefined schedule and also requires the payment of interest in addition to the original amount that you borrow.

Debt does not convey ownership. Equity does. Okay. Equity is essentially the owner's investment in the company and it does convey ownership. Okay. So debt is basically other people's money that a company has borrowed and is using to create value. And that money ultimately has to be paid back, including interest. Equity is essentially the owner's money. Okay. So that does convey ownership. Now we're going to talk about debt and equity a lot more throughout the course. Okay. We're going to talk about it in considerable detail. But I did want to mention it here. Just because it is such a key component to understanding financial management, I wanted to close this lecture just by again re emphasizing the role of accounting in this course. Okay. As I've discussed earlier, accounting is a rigorous profession. It can be very complex and does require years to master. Remember that this course only scratches the surface. Okay. So yes, we do learn to read the financial statements, but please do keep in mind that we're not going to expect any of you to fully understand the bookkeeping process, the generation of journals or ledgers or anything like that. Our focus is on understanding the information once it's already made its way to an income statement, a balance sheet or a statement of cash flow or a statement of retained earnings.

Okay. So we're looking essentially at that final product and then doing an analysis on it. An engineer is unlikely to be a master of accounting, But again, that doesn't mean that we can't do intelligent analysis of financial statements. And really that's our focus on understanding those financial statements so that we may use them to make informed decisions. I very briefly wanted to refer you to an example In the course package. There is an example on accounting that briefly asks you to answer questions related to describing accounting, giving three examples where the decision maker is likely to use financial statements to give three examples of the users of financial statements. Again, the purpose of these questions is just to get you thinking about these issues. I have provided some illustrative answers in the example, and I'm not going to go through those in class, but do ask that you spend a few minutes considering those. So that's all I wanted to say in today's lecture. Remember, much of the material that we covered today is important in terms of providing context, in terms of understanding where the information comes from for the financial statements that we're going to look at over the next several lectures. So it is important that you do understand that once information does get to the income statement, the balance sheet, the statement of retained earnings or the statement of cash flow, that there has been that very rigorous process applied in order to get into that information.",5117,"[-0.0161663  -0.00214739  0.00647742 ... -0.01917905  0.00886518

Financial Statements - Balance sheet,3.3,CEFA,"Title: Financial Statements - Balance sheet; Description: In the video transcript for the course ENMA 600 on cost estimation and financial analysis, the key takeaways are as follows: 
The instructor explains that the balance sheet is a critical financial statement that provides insights into a company's financial health. It distinguishes between capital shares and retained earnings and consists of various components such as current assets, fixed assets, intangible assets, current liabilities, long-term liabilities, and shareholders' equity. 
Current assets are economic resources that are expected to generate future cash inflows or reduce future cash outflows, including cash, inventory, and receivables. Fixed assets are tangible items like land, buildings, natural resources, and equipment, while intangible assets include franchises, patents, trademarks, copyrights, and goodwill. 
Current liabilities are obligations that are due within one year, such as short-term credit line notes payable, while long-term liabilities have prescribed repayment schedules and are due beyond one year. Stockholders' equity represents the money that shareholders have invested in the business, including capital shares and retained earnings. 
The instructor explains that debt and equity differ in terms of ownership and repayment requirements, with debt requiring interest payments. Net working capital, which is the difference between current assets and current liabilities, is a crucial metric for assessing short-term financial health and obtaining short-term credit from banks. 
In the example given, the instructor provides calculations for the value of current assets, current liabilities, the current portion of long-term debt, and accounts payable based on the given information. However, information on other components of the balance sheet is missing, making it impossible to calculate the total value of assets, liabilities, and equity. 
The instructor highlights the importance of analyzing both the balance sheet and income statement to gain a comprehensive understanding of a company's financial position. The balance sheet reflects the financial position at a specific point in time, while the income statement shows events over a period of time. Both statements are necessary for accurate interpretation of a business's performance. 

Lastly, the instructor emphasizes the significance of considering cash reserves and equity when assessing a company's ability to withstand financial difficulties.; Transcript: Greetings In this lecture. We're going to continue our study of the financial statements. And in particular, we're going to focus on the balance sheet to give you an idea of what to expect over the next few moments, we're going to talk, first of all, about the form of the balance sheet. And I'll then go through the key components of the balance sheet, and then we'll spend a few moments talking about net working capital. And this is an important topic because net working capital is generally one of the first two things you look at when evaluating the short term health of a business. The other is cash flow. As we're going through this, please keep in mind that the balance sheet shows the status of a business entity at a particular instant in time. Essentially, it tells us what we have and where we got it. Okay, so this is information different than that presented in the income statement and also different than that from the statement of retained earnings in the statement of cash flow. Okay. So where is the income statement was for a moving span of a picture of events over a period of time. The balance sheet shows the status of a business entity at a particular instant in time. Okay. So for a given moment, the balance sheet has two counterbalancing sections. The left side lists assets, and basically assets represent the resources of the company. Okay, The right side lists liabilities and stockholders equity. This side represents claims against the company's resources, and it's very important to note that the left and right sides are always kept in balance.

That's what we mean when we say balance sheet. Now the relationship between assets, liabilities and stockholders equity is represented in what we call the balance sheet equation or the accounting equation. Okay. Both of those names are commonly used to represent the equation given in the box. Okay, so assets, equal liabilities plus stockholders equity. Keep in mind that this must always balance. Okay, so the sum of the firm's assets must always equal the sum of its liabilities plus the sum of its stakeholders. Equity Stated another way, the balance sheet answers two important questions How much do I have? That's the assets and how did I pay for it? That's the liabilities and stakeholder or stockholders equity. Now, when reading the balance sheet, we must always keep in mind that accounting is conservative. Okay? So in times of high inflation, book values often deviate from real values. Okay? So if the asset is useful, it is recorded at book value. This is the lesser of the original cost minus depreciation or market value. Okay. So book value again is basically taking the original cost and then subtracting the accumulated depreciation. So if an asset is useful, its book value is either the lower or pardon me, it's the lower of the book value or the market value. If the market value is higher than the book value, it is never recognized in advance of being realized.

Okay. So even if the if the market value of a particular asset is higher than the book value, you wouldn't change your balance sheet. Okay? You never recognize increases in the value of an asset until you actually realize it, until you actually sell that asset for a price greater than its book value. If an asset is worn out or useless, it is written off. Okay. And this is done through depreciation and or write downs. The form of the balance sheet is displayed here on the screen, and it's important to note that there are different forms of the balance sheet that are generally used. One is displayed here on the screen, shows assets on the left side and then liabilities and stockholders equity on the right side. But you don't necessarily have to present it visually like this. Sometimes it's done in a tabular format or vertically where assets would be at the top, then you'd have liabilities, then you'd have stockholders equity. In any case, what's most important is, again, the sum of all of the assets must equal the sum of the liabilities and the stockholders equity. Okay. So again, that goes back to the balance sheet equation or the accounting equation. Now working our way through the elements of the balance sheet. And again, we're going to talk about each of these components a little bit more later on throughout the lecture. You can see first in the upper left hand corner, we have current assets.

Okay. Current assets include things like cash marketable securities and marketable. Marketable securities are basically short term investments that are expected to be converted to cash in less than a year. We have receivables, which is essentially money owed to the company by people who have purchased our products but have not yet paid us. And we have inventory and of course inventory are items that are used to produce other products, items that we use to add value. So the test for current assets is basically anything that is expected to be converted into cash within one year. Under current assets, we have fixed assets and these are the assets essentially that we do not anticipate converting into cash in one year, but rather we use these assets to add value to raw materials. So these include things like property, plant and equipment, and we always list the original purchase price of the assets. Okay? We always list the original purchase price of the property plant and equipment, and then we also list the accumulated depreciation. Okay. Remember, the book value of the asset is its original purchase price minus the accumulated depreciation. And both of those items actually show up on the balance sheet. This gives us a sense of how aged or how old the assets are. Long term investments are another thing that we tend to see on the asset side, and again, these are investments that we do not anticipate. Converting into cash in the near future or in the next 12 months something.

Like a long term bond might be a long term investment. And then last but not least, we have. Goodwill and intangible assets on the liability side. So again, now moving over to the right side of the balance sheet. We also have current liabilities and current liabilities are liabilities which we expect to satisfy within the next 12 months. So we expect to pay these liabilities off in the next 12 months. These include notes payable, accounts payable. Okay, Notes payable is basically the short term credit line at a bank. So money that you borrowed from the bank that you anticipate paying back in the next year, money that you borrowed on a short term basis, pardon me accounts payable is basically the opposite of receivables. Okay. So this is money that we've promised to pay our suppliers accruals, which includes wages, employee wages and taxes. And then we have the current portion of the long term debt, which is the portion of the long term debt that is due within the coming 12 months. Long term liabilities include long term debt, which is debt essentially that we are not planning on paying back over the next 12 months. And then you have repayable grants under stockholders equity. We have two categories. One is capital shares, the other is retained earnings. Capital shares basically represents a cash injection. Okay? This is money that the owners of the business have put into the business. Retained earnings is money that the company has retained, that it is kept in the business, that it did not redistribute to stockholders as a dividend, but instead chose to keep in the business as retained earnings.

And again, the retained earnings value comes from the statement of retained earnings. Now many of those observations are summarized on this slide. Okay. So I talked a little bit about the fact that we use the one year rule for current. Okay? So if something is a current asset or a current liability, that basically means that it's going to be converted into cash in the case of the asset within 12 months, or you're going to have to pay off that that liability within 12 months. In the case of current liabilities, the balance sheet is organized in decreasing order of liquidity, and liquidity is basically a measure of how fast we can turn something into cash. Okay. So just very quickly bouncing back to the balance sheet here, you note that on the asset side, okay, we have cash marketable securities receivables and inventory. Cash obviously is already in cash. So it's very easy to convert that to cash because it's cash. Okay. It can be exchanged immediately for a good or service. Marketable securities typically are very easy to convert into cash because they are short term investments, receivables and inventory. And then moving down. We have fixed assets which are generally a little bit more difficult to to turn into cash than the current assets. Note that we always state the at cost value of the fixed assets as this gives the ability to have a sense of the age of the assets.

And again, that was something I mentioned when we were looking at the form of the balance sheet. It's important to note that goodwill and intangible assets can also be depreciated. Okay. So when we looked at fixed assets, it was very clear that they can be depreciated because we very explicitly take into account the accumulative. We explicitly list the accumulated depreciation on the previous slide, but goodwill and intangible assets can also be depreciated. Okay. So for example, goodwill is basically the excess payment for a business over its book value. Okay, so let's say that you purchase a window company that's worth $1 million and you pay $3 Million for that company, you would then enter a goodwill of $2 million. Okay. On your balance sheet. Okay. That's the purchase price, 3 million minus its book value of 1 million. If the value of that window company decreases over time, Let's say, for instance, that you purchase another brand and you plan on changing the name of that company to your own brand, and the value of that brand is going to diminish over time. You can actually depreciate the value of that brand, and in that case, you would also have to list accumulated depreciation. Other intangible assets include trademarks or patents. Again, these can be depreciated over time if their value is expected to decrease over time. The current portion of the long term debt is also subject to the one year test.

Okay, so the current portion of long term debt is the portion of the debt that you're going to pay back within the next 12 months. Anything that you're not going to pay back within the next 12 months would be entered under the long term debt section. The other thing that the balance sheet does, again, is it distinguishes between capital shares, which is again, money that owners of the company have injected into the business from retained earnings, which is money that the company has earned itself and retained in the business. The key components of the balance sheet then are current assets, fixed assets, intangible assets, current liabilities, long term liabilities and shareholders equity. And we're going to spend just a few minutes considering each of these components over the next few slides. Current assets. Basically, the first thing we need to understand is that an asset is an economic resource that is expected to benefit future cash inflows or help future cash or help reduce future cash outflows. Examples of these, of course, include cash inventory receivables. Those are all examples of. Own assets and as I mentioned earlier, cash plus other assets that are expected to be converted to cash or sold or consumed during the next 12 months are what we consider current assets. Physical assets or fixed assets, pardon me, include physical or tangible items that can be seen and touched like land buildings, natural resources and equipment.

It's normal, again to show the full purchase price of fixed assets and then to show the accumulated depreciation as a reduction, because once again, this does give us a sense of how age the assets are. Intangible assets include rights or economic benefits such as franchises, patents, trademarks, copyrights and goodwill that are not physical in nature. But do keep in mind that these things can have enormous value. So a patent might actually have some some value to the company. Goodwill, as I mentioned before, is the excess paid for a company over its book value. And once again, intangible assets can be depreciated over time if they have a limited life. And the term for depreciating intangible assets is called amortization. Current liabilities are liabilities that fall due within one year. Short term credit line notes payable is one of the most common current liabilities and one that you need to pay particular attention to because it may be called at any time. Short term credit line is basically money that the bank has agreed to lend on a short term basis. We're going to discuss short term credit lines in more detail later on in the course. And as I've mentioned before, the current portion of the long term debt is included as a current liability since it is due within the coming year. Long term liabilities. These are obligations that fall due beyond one year from the balance sheet date and almost all long term debt has a prescribed repayment schedule.

It's not callable except in the case of default and is secured. Okay, so what all that means is that long term debt, typically the bank can't demand that you pay them immediately because they do have prescribed repayment terms. So as long as you don't violate the terms of the agreement, you pay it on the basis of that prescribed agreement. If you do violate the terms of the agreement, then typically the bank or whoever has lent you the money will have the right to demand the immediate repayment. So maybe just summarizing key point about liabilities. A liability is an economic obligation of the organization to outsiders or claims against its assets by by outsiders. And again, we have current and long term liabilities with the key test being one year. The other item that is on the right side of the balance sheet is stockholders equity and stockholders equity measures. The amount of money that shareholders have left in a business okay consists again of capital shares and retained earnings capital shares of the money put into the business by the sale of shares in the company. And this could include preferred stock, common stock and paid in capital in excess of par. Each of these we're going to discuss in greater detail when we look at stocks. So I'm not going to spend any more time on that right now. But just keep in mind that there is for now at least, keep in mind that there is that distinction between money that owners have invested in the company and money that the company has earned and kept in the business itself.

Remember, once again, that debt and equity are different. Okay? Debt is other people's money. It does not convey ownership in the company. Normally it requires a specified period of repayment and the payment of interest. So whatever you have to pay debt, of course you have to pay not only the original amount of the loan, but some fee essentially for borrowing that money. And that's what we call interest equity or owner's money does convey ownership in the business. And this again, is discussed in greater detail later on in the course. Net working capital is another thing that I very briefly wanted to just introduce here. It is something that we're going to look at in considerably more detail later on in the course. Basically, it's the difference between current assets and current liabilities. It's the extra cost of being in business over and above fixed assets. So to calculate the net working capital, you take the current assets and you subtract the current liabilities. The net working capital ratio is often referred to as the current ratio. Is the current assets divided by the current liabilities? I just wanted to introduce it here because again, net working capital is something is typically one of the first two things you look at when evaluating the short term health of the business. Once again, typically we'll look at net working capital and we will look at cash flow to make sure that a business is viable in the short term.

And because of that, adequacy of net working capital is often one of the key tests for the provision of a short term credit line by a bank. Now we're going to come back to the concept of net working capital later on in the course, but it is something that I needed to introduce in order to go through the example on the balance sheet that you have in your course package. And I very briefly want to go over that just to make sure that all the points associated with this example are clear. Okay. So if you pull that up and follow along, that would be great. In this example, we know the following things about a distribution business. Okay? Cogs for the business is the purchase cost of goods. No other items go into Cogs. The gross profit margin of the business is 25%. And we know. From our study of the income statement. If the gross profit margin of the business is 25%, then the cost of goods sold must be 75%. Okay. As a result of careful credit checks, bad debt is insignificant. Monthly sales are steady at $2 million per month. The business floats on a short term credit line and has no cash or short term investments on hand. So we know that marketable securities and cash are both equal to zero. Accrued expenses are negligible. There are no taxes payable.

The long term debt is a $400,000 loan with a straight line principal repayment period over a ten year period, which essentially means that the repayment is $40,000 per year for ten years. Receivables are running at 42 days of sales. And it's important to note that often receivables and inventory are quoted in days of sales to provide some context for the size of the number. Okay. If we just say that receivables are $1 million, we don't necessarily know if that is significant, if we don't know what the sales are for that business. So to provide some context. Companies and financial managers often will quote receivables in inventory, in particular in the number of days of sales. Inventory is running at 54 days of sales. Suppliers are faithfully paid on net 30 day terms, which means that we pay all of our debts as scheduled. And we've also got the fact. We also know the fact that the short term lender has specified a minimum working capital ratio, which is the current assets divided by the current liabilities of two. So again, that gets back to that notion of net working capital. We know that we must have twice as many current assets as current liabilities is essentially what that last bullet point is telling us. Question. Can you complete a full balance sheet for this company? If yes, please do so. If not, show what information is missing by placing an X in those spots. Okay. So working our way through the balance sheet, we know that cash and marketable securities are zero.

And we were told that in one of the bullet points above, we can calculate the receivables in inventory using the information given. So in the case of receivables, we were told that receivables were running at 42 days of sales. Okay. We're going to assume a 30 day month so that that that those sales were accumulated over 30 days. Stated another way. So your receivables can therefore be calculated by taking 42 days of sales, dividing it by the number of days in the month with this 30 days and multiplying it by the amount of sales for that month of $2 million. Our receivables therefore come to about $2.8 million. Inventory can be calculated similarly. So we know that the value of inventory is 54 days of sales. So you take 54 divided by 30, which is again the number of days in the month multiplied by 2 million, and that gives us 3.6 million. If you add those up, you can get the value of your current assets to be 6.4 million. Now we know the value of our current liabilities has to be half of the value of the current assets. Okay. Again, that point was noted in this last bullet point. We were told that our net working capital ratio was two. That means our current assets are double the amount of current liabilities. Therefore, we can figure out what our current liabilities are by taking the value of the current assets of 6.4 million.

Dividing that by two and getting a current liabilities of 3.2 million. So 6.4 million divided by 2 million is 3.2 million. Next, working our way through current liabilities. We know that the current portion of our long term debt is $40,000. Okay. The way that we figure that out is by going up to the information pertaining to long term debt repayment. We are told that we have to pay $40,000 per year for ten years and within the coming year, therefore, we would have to pay $40,000 of that. Okay, So the current liabilities are the current portion of the long term debt is therefore 40,000 and the long term debt owing beyond one year is therefore 360,000. Okay, so that's just the $400,000 debt minus the current portion of the debt of 40,000 to get $360,000. Accounts payable can be calculated by using that information pertaining to the gross profit margin. So we were given information telling us that the gross profit margin for the business is 25%. We therefore know that the cost of goods sold is 75%. If we then take the number of sales or the amount of the sales pardon me, of $2 million, multiply that by 75%. We can get the value of accounts payable that comes to 1.5 million. And last but not least, we have this value for notes payable. This is basically the plug factor. Okay. This is the balancing entry to make the value of the current liabilities to be 3200.

So in order to make the balance sheet balance, we know that we would have had to have borrowed 1.6, $6 million from the bank on a short term basis. The question also asked us to place an X in the areas where we were missing information. That's done so here. Okay. So we weren't given any information pertaining to property, plant and equipment or its accumulated depreciation. There was no information on long term investments or goodwill. Therefore, it's impossible for us to calculate the total value of the assets. And we also weren't given information on repayable grants on capital shares. Retained earnings and therefore we can't calculate the total liabilities and equities either. What we would know, however, in any case, is again that the total assets would equal the total liabilities and total equity. So that's something that we would know from the balance sheet equation or the accounting equation, whatever term you prefer, the sum of total assets must always equal the sum of total liabilities and equity. So summarizing some of the key points from the previous two lectures, just looking at the balance sheet versus the income statement. Remember that the balance sheet provides a picture of the company's financial position at an instant in time. So it's a measure of wealth at an instant, in time. At a particular moment in time. The income statement, however, provides some different information. It essentially provides a moving picture of events over a span of time.

So it measures a rate to understand a business. We need both. So you can't just look at the income statement and you can't look just at the balance sheet and expect that you would have an accurate interpretation of how the business is doing. The income statement will tell us how much value you are creating by using the assets in the balance sheet will tell you how much you have and how much you owe. So we need to look at both of them to understand how the business is doing. So if, for example, an income statement shows a significant book in cash loss, we know the business is losing money. However, if the balance sheet shows substantial cash reserves, then we get a sense if the company can weather the storm or not. Whether or not it has time to improve its performance. Okay. We can contrast that with a company losing the same amount of money that has minimal equity. It would very quickly run into trouble. So therefore, anyone trying to understand a company's position must look at both the income statement and the balance sheet. So that's all I wanted to cover in today's lecture. Again, many of the topics that we addressed today will be covered in greater detail later on. In the course in particular, we'll look at net working capital towards the end of the course and we'll also look at the study of the assets and liabilities management in greater detail later on.",5512,"[-2.49968469e-02  1.14644282e-02 -3.43634451e-06 ... -5.09242900e-03

Financial Statements - Cash Flow,3.4,CEFA,"Title: Financial Statements - Cash Flow; Description: In this video transcript, the instructor emphasizes the importance of the statement of cash flows in understanding a company's financial performance. The statement of cash flows tracks all cash flows into and out of a company, providing key information about cash receipts and payments during a specific period. This information is crucial for a company's survival, as cash is needed for returning cash to owners and paying creditors. The statement of cash flows complements the income statement and balance sheet, offering unique insights into a company's cash generation and use. It helps evaluate a company's ability to pay interest, dividends, and debts when they are due, and assists in predicting future cash flows and identifying changes in productive assets. Inflows and outflows of cash are central to understanding the statement of cash flows, with inflows representing money coming into the business and outflows referring to money going out of the business. The video also explains the distinction between an increase or decrease in an asset or liability account and how it impacts inflows and outflows of cash. The statement of cash flows categorizes cash flow into operating activities, financing activities, and investing activities, with cash inflows listed as positive and cash outflows listed as negative. The video provides detailed explanations of each component of the statement of cash flow and emphasizes the importance of correctly classifying items to create an accurate statement. It is highlighted that the statement of cash flows connects the income statement and balance sheet, providing insights into the company's cash position. The instructor mentions that more detailed discussions will be covered in the course, particularly focusing on cash flows in decision-making within a business. Overall, the video underscores the significance of the statement of cash flows in evaluating a company's financial position and predicting future cash flows.; Transcript: Hello again. In this lecture, we're going to continue our study of the financial statements. In particular, we're going to focus on the statement of cash flows. Okay. So to give you an idea of what to expect in this lecture, we're going to start off with a very brief introduction to the statement of cash flows and then follow that by a discussion with a discussion of the inflows and outflows of cash. We'll talk a little bit about the form of the statement of cash flows and then we'll talk a little bit about the key components of the statement of cash flow. Just to give you a little bit more detail on each of those components, the statement of cash flows reports the cash receipts and cash payments of a company during a particular period of time. And this is a very important point because as we discussed earlier on in the course, cash is breath. Okay, Without it, a company will be finished very quickly. And because of that, managers of a firm tend to pay a lot of attention to the statement of cash flows to make sure that they know and understand where their cash is going and where it's coming from. Since a business is usually returned, usually form to return cash to its owners, and because creditors must be paid in cash, Statement of cash Flow is a critical report. It tracks essentially what it does is it tracks all the cash flow into and out of a company.

And because of this, it's an essential complement to the income statement and the balance sheet. And this gets back to the point, of course, that each of the financial statements has its own set of unique information, and we need to understand all of the statements if we're going to get an accurate picture of how a company is performing from a financial perspective. And as I mentioned earlier, cash is breath. A company can't survive without it. And one of the ways to that I've found useful to think about this is if I write a check, will the bank cash it? If the answer is no, then the business is in serious difficulty. The statement of cash flow is useful for a number of reasons. One is that it shows the relationship of net income to the changes in the cash balances. It's also very useful for helping us to predict future cash flows. Of course, looking at information generated based on past data is not always going to tell us exactly what will happen in the future, but at the same time, it can help provide some insight into the way things may unfold. The statement of cash flow is very useful in evaluating management's generation and use of cash, and it's also very useful in determining a company's ability to pay interest and dividends and to pay debts when they are due, because again, the payment of interest, dividends and other debts requires cash.

The other thing that the statement of cash flow does is it helps us identify changes in the mix of productive assets. Now, to understand the statement of cash flow, we first must understand the notion of inflows and outflows of cash. So we're going to spend a few moments just talking about what we mean by inflows and outflows of cash at a base level. Essentially, inflows of cash are money that comes into the business, and outflows of cash are money that goes out of the business when the company actually has to reach into its wallet, pull out some cash and hand it off to somebody else. Inflows of cash are treated as a positive number from the perspective of the company, and outflows of cash are treated as a negative number. From the perspective of the company, that's a very important point, and you must understand that in order to understand how to put together and how to interpret a statement of cash flow, again, inflows of cash are treated as a positive from the perspective of the company. Outflows of cash are treated as a negative from the perspective of the company. Some illustrative examples of inflows of cash and outflows of cash are given on the slide here. Inflows of cash include a decrease in any asset or an increase in any liability. And we'll talk about why that's the case on the next slide.

Inflows of cash also include any net profits after taxes, depreciation and other non-cash items are treated as inflows of cash. Recall that depreciation is a paper reduction of income. It doesn't actually involve any cash flowing out of the company. And sale of stock is another example of an inflow of cash from the perspective of outflows of cash, which again is represented as a negative from the perspective of the company, it could be an increase in any asset or a decrease in any liability. And again, the reasons for this are highlighted on the next slide. Any net loss, any dividends paid, the payment of dividends, of course, requires the payment of cash or the repurchase or retirement of stock or other examples of outflows of cash. Now, when we're looking at and we're studying inflows and outflows of cash, it may be very useful to keep the following points in mind. It may help keep things clear. And when we're looking at the study of assets, it's important to remember that they measure real things of value. Okay, so whenever you have an increase in an asset account, you have to use some funds in order in order to acquire those assets. Okay. Because of that, any increase in an asset account is essentially an outflow of cash. Okay. A decrease in an asset account, on the other hand, is a source of funds.

Okay. So if your asset account has gone down, let's say that your inventory has gone down, for instance, then hopefully you've turned that that asset into some cash liabilities. On the other hand, measure real obligations to pay someone else. An increase in a liability is a source of funds. And the reason for this is that you are essentially borrowing more from someone else. So if your net, if your notes payable go up or your accounts payable go up, that essentially means that you're borrowing more money from some other lender of funds or from some other supplier. Because of that, we consider an increase in a liability, a source of funds, a decrease in a liability, on the other hand, is a use of funds. So in order to reduce your notes payable, for instance, you had to use some cash to lower that outstanding obligation. Okay. So again, the inflows and outflows of cash. It's very important to understand this notion of assets and liabilities to help us understand when we actually have to pay cash and when we actually are receiving cash or receiving something of value. An increase in equity or retained earnings is always a source of funds. And depreciation is also a source of funds since it is a non cash expense. Now we use the concept of inflows and outflows of cash in order to generate a statement of cash flow. And one of the reasons we do put this statement of cash flow together is it does help make the reflection on the inflows and outflows of cash easier.

That being said, you cannot put together a statement of cash flow if you don't understand the notion of inflows and outflows of cash. And to better help you understand that there is a homework problem on inflows and outflows of cash that has been assigned. And I do encourage you to go through that and make sure that you understand the solution to that particular problem. What the statement of cash flow does in order to make the reflection on inflows and outflows of cash easier is it breaks the funds flow into three preset categories. They are operating activities, financing activities and investing activities. We're going to look at each of those over the next few slides. And again, essentially what it does is it helps us to take these inflows and outflows of cash and put them into some method of categorization to help guide our analysis and action. Of course, whenever you put together a statement of cash flow, the balancing entry is cash and marketable securities. And the reason marketable securities are included here is essentially they are considered near cash. They're very easy typically to two to convert into cash. So typically they're included in on the bottom line of the statement of cash flow, which typically measures the net increase or decrease in cash and marketable securities.

The form of the statement of cash flow is summarized here. And again, the key to understanding the statement of cash flow is understanding cash inflows and outflows. And as I mentioned earlier, cash inflows are listed as positive and cash outflows are listed as negative. So whenever you're putting together the statement of cash flow, any cash inflow from the company's perspective, that's a positive number. Any cash outflow from the perspective of the company is a negative number. As I mentioned. What the statement of cash flow does is it essentially breaks those inflows and outflows of cash into three categories operating activities, net investing activities and financing activities. Those categories are displayed here on the screen. And this gives you some idea of the items that go into each of those three categories. So operating activities, for instance, includes net profits after taxes. And again, net profits are always listed after taxes on the statement of cash flow. Depreciation decreases in accounts receivable, decreases in inventory, increases in accounts payable, increases in accruals, and then basically what you do is you add all of these things up in order to get your operating activities and changes associated with the operating activities. Investing activities typically include increases in gross fixed assets and changes in other business interests. Whereas financing activities would include decreases in notes payable, increases in long term debt, changes in the capital structures and dividends paid. And again, in order to get the net increase in cash or marketable securities, essentially what you do is you add up all the operating activities, all the investing activities and all the financing activities.

So the net increase in cash and marketable securities is the operating activities plus the investing activities plus the financing activities. Now, again, the next few slides will help give a bit more detail on each of the components associated with the statement of cash flow operating activities. We can see shows net profits in full, not retained earnings. You have to take into account depreciation and any other non cash charge because remember again, depreciation is a paper reduction of income. It doesn't actually involve cash flowing out of the business. The other thing that we need to take into account in operating activities is to add or subtract changes in non-cash working capital. So non cash working capital includes current assets other than cash, things like inventory and receivables for investing activities. We have to add or subtract the asset acquisition costs and the changes in business interests. And for financing activities, we have to either add or subtract the equity injection or withdrawal. We have to take into account any new long term borrowing or repayment that we've made. And we also have to subtract any dividends that we paid. And again, adding all these things together will give us our change in net cash position. Once again, the most important point in putting together the statement of cash flows is recognizing inflows of cash are positive from the perspective of the company and outflows of cash are negative from the perspective of the company.

And I know I probably sound like a bit of a broken record on that point, but really that is the key to understand. The statement of cash flows. And it's very important to keep that point in mind because that will essentially act as a mechanism that will allow you to put together this statement of cash flow. Now operating activities. We have some example inflows and outflows displayed here on the screen. I've done the same thing for investing and financing activities over the next couple of slides, just to give you some illustrative examples of cash flows associated with each of these activities. From the operating activity perspective, when we're looking at cash inflows, this could include things like collections from customers interest in dividends collected or other operating receipts. Example cash outflows must include might include cash payments to suppliers, cash payments to employees interest and taxes paid, and other operating cash payments. From the investing activity perspective, we have some more examples of inflows and outflows from the inflows perspective. Sale of property, plant and or equipment sale of securities that are not cash equivalents and receipt of loan payments would all be example inflows under the investing activities category, whereas the purchase of plant property or equipment of securities that are not cash equivalents or making loans would be example cash outflows associated with investing activities, financing activities.

Example cash inflows could include borrowing cash from creditors, issuing equity securities or issuing debt securities. Example cash outflows could include the repayment of amounts borrowed, the repurchase of equity shares or the payment of dividends. Again, the key point being that inflows of cash would be positive from the perspective of the company outflows of cash, negative from the perspective of the company, to help demonstrate the concept of operating financing and investing activities. I did include an example in your course package, and I'll just spend a few moments going over this because it does help clarify how we can classify operating activities, investing activities and cash flow from financing activities. So this example is entitled Statement of Cash flows. And basically what we've been given is a whole bunch of items, and then we're asked to include each expense or revenue as a cash flow from operating investment or financing activities. And what I've done here is just gone through each of these one by one. And again, the purpose of this is just to help give you some practice in classifying each of these cash flows so that you can put them into the correct category In your statement of cash flow. Administrative expenses, for example, would be an operating activity. Rent payment would also be an operating activity. Operating activities, of course, are associated with the day to day running of the business.

Interest on notes payable and interest on notes receivable would be considered financing activities. Financing activities are concerned with where you got the money to operate your business and investing. Activities, of course, are associated with investments in fixed assets. So something like the sale of equipment would be an investing activity going down the list. Again, you would see the dividend payments and stock repurchases would be considered financing activities, the sale of finished goods and labor expense. Those are associated with the day to day running of the business and are therefore operating activities. Sale of a bond issue and repayment of long term debt are clearly financing activities, selling expenses, depreciation expenses, operating activities, sale of common stock financing and purchase of fixed assets would be an investing activity. So that gives you some ideas on how we classify these items within the statement of cash flow to complete a statement of cash flow, then to balance sheets from the start of the period and the end of the period and the income statement for the intervening time period must be used. So in order to figure out these changes, to figure out these inflows and outflows of cash, basically what you do is you look at two balance sheets, look at the differences between them in order to figure out your inflows and outflows of cash using the information we discussed earlier as it pertains to assets and liabilities and how those relate to inflows and outflows of cash.

And the statement of cash flow gives us the net cash position from an operational and financial management perspective. All businesses, of course, require that management addresses these two areas. Operational health. Does our underlying business activity create value independent of how we finance the business? From a financial perspective, have we raised money in a way that can sustain the business? The income statement is the primary source of evidence of operational health, so it basically tells us whether or not we're creating value from the day to day activities of our business. The balance sheet is the primary source of evidence of financial health. So it tells us how much money we have and where we got the money for it. And the statement of cash flow basically links these two. It uses information from both the balance sheet and the income statement to give us an idea of what happened to our cash. Now, many of the things that we discussed in this very brief lecture will be talked about in considerably more detail throughout the course. As you'll see as we get into the course, much of our focus is actually on cash flows associated with decision making in a business. So hopefully more of the items are within this particular lecture will become a little bit more clear as we get into the rest of the course.",3734,"[-0.03483817 -0.00253555 -0.00532986 ... -0.00934067  0.00909453

Analyzing Cash Flow,4.0,CEFA,"Title: Analyzing Cash Flow; Description: The key takeaway from this video is that analyzing a firm's cash flow is crucial for understanding its performance. The video covers several important aspects related to cash flow analysis. It starts by discussing depreciation and the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS), which is the depreciation method used for tax reporting in the United States. Depreciation helps to lower the amount of taxes a firm has to pay by systematically allocating the cost of fixed assets against annual revenues over time. The video also introduces the concepts of operating cash flow and free cash flow, which are important in managerial decision making and capital market monitoring, respectively. It highlights the difference between income and cash flow, with depreciation having an impact on income but not on cash flow. The video explains different methods of depreciation for reporting purposes, such as straight line, double declining balance, and sum of years. However, the focus in this course is on depreciation for tax purposes, as it is relevant for engineering cash flow analysis. The video provides examples of assets falling within different recovery periods and displays the MACRS depreciation rates by asset class. It emphasizes the importance of adding depreciation back to net profit after taxes to calculate operating cash flow accurately, as depreciation does not involve a cash outlay. Overall, the video emphasizes the significance of understanding cash flow and depreciation in analyzing a firm's performance and introduces key concepts and calculations related to cash flow analysis.; Transcript: Greetings. As we discussed in an earlier lecture for a company, cash is cash is breath. Okay. So with that in mind, one of the key skills in analyzing a firm's performance is being able to analyze the firm's cash flow. And that's what we're going to look at today. To give you a better idea of what to expect over the next few minutes, we'll start by talking about depreciation and makers and makers. Is the modified accelerated cost recovery system. I'm going to talk a little bit more about what that is in a few minutes. But essentially that's the depreciation for tax reporting mechanism in the United States. Depreciation, of course, is a topic that we introduced very briefly when we talked about the income statement. And what we're going to do today is build on that earlier discussion and go into a bit more detail. We're also going to spend a few minutes talking about operating cash flow and free cash flow just to make sure that you know what those are, since they are things that you may occasionally encounter in industry. So by way of introduction, cash flow as well as profit is an important focus of a general manager. And that's something that we've talked about before. We need to understand both cash flow and profit, but we also need to keep in mind that they are not the same thing. So while both are very important and I likened them earlier to being like two wheels on a cart, they are not the same thing.

And there is differences. And one of the key differences to understanding the difference between income and cash flow is depreciation. Okay. Keep in mind, as we discussed earlier, that depreciation reduces income, but not cash flow. And that's a point that we're going to come back to later on. In this lecture, we also talked about the fact that cash flow is summarized in the statement of cash flows. Operating cash flow and free cash flow are two other topics that we're going to introduce in today's lecture. Operating cash flow is most commonly used in managerial decision making, while free cash flow is closely monitored by the capital market. And again, we're going to look at the distinction between these later on in this lecture. Depreciation, as we discussed earlier, is the systematic allocation of a portion of the cost of fixed assets against annual revenues over time. Typically, depreciable property must meet three criteria. One is that it's used in a business produce income. Two is that the determinable life that is greater than one year, and three, that it must deteriorate or become obsolete over time or with use. So the vast majority of property in used in industry, the vast majority pardon me, of fixed assets used within industry are depreciable. The one exception, of course, is land. Land is not depreciable.

And that's a point that we need to keep in mind as we work our way through the discussion of depreciation. Depreciation for tax purposes is determined by using the modified accelerated cost recovery system. Macrs is how I'll commonly abbreviate. That is an accelerated, accelerated form of depreciation. Okay. Remember, depreciation for reporting purposes is often more conservative. So it is important to note that it's perfectly valid and perfectly legal to have two methods of depreciation and essentially to have two sets of books. One is depreciation for tax purposes, the other is depreciation for reporting purposes. Again, depreciation for tax purposes tends to be more accelerated. And one of the reasons for this is that higher depreciation rates, remember, lower the amount of operating income a firm has, which means that the firm will pay less taxes. So essentially what depreciation does is it lowers the amount of taxes that a firm will have to pay. And one of the reasons the government does this, one of the reasons why they use accelerated mechanisms of depreciation is that it helps encourage investment. If firms invest in equipment, if they invest in fixed assets, then their tax bill should go down over the period that that item is being depreciated. So that's for tax purposes. For reporting purposes, there are different methods of depreciation, including the straight line, double declining balance and sum of years method. All of these methods tend to be time oriented, whereas the units of production method tends to be usage oriented.

One of the reasons why companies tend to use different depreciation methods for reporting than tax purposes is that other methods that are commonly used in reporting tend to more closely match the actual usage of the item and therefore give a fairer representation of the company's ability to create value. Okay. Remember, the income statement essentially measures the company's ability to create value. And when you're doing it for reporting purposes to your to your stockholders and to investors and your stockholders reports, you want to give the most accurate depiction possible of the company's ability to create value. Depreciation for tax purposes, however, remember, is an accelerated form of depreciation and actually tends to fully depreciate an item faster than the item is actually used up faster than it's it becomes obsolete. Our focus in this course is on depreciation for tax purposes. If you're interested in learning more about the depreciation methods for reporting reporting purposes, you can find information on these other depreciation methods in virtually any engineering economics or financial accounting textbook. We're not going to cover it in this course, since those are things that tend to be done by accountants. Since accountants are more responsible for external reporting, we're going to focus on depreciation for tax purposes. Because these are the types of calculations that you typically need to take into account in engineering cash flow analysis.

So engineering managers are generally concerned with cash flows rather than profits. That's not to say again that profits aren't important. They are just that engineers tend to work more with with cash flows. And again, that's one of the reasons why we're going to focus more on the depreciation for tax reporting purposes, because that's the depreciation method that we use in all of our capital budgeting calculations that we'll do later on in the course. As I was talking, as I mentioned in an earlier lecture to adjust the income statement to show cash flows from operations, all non cash charges should be added back in to the net profit after taxes. Okay. So in order to figure out a firm's operating cash flow, we essentially have to add the depreciation back in. And the reason that we do that is since depreciation is deducted for tax purposes but does not actually require any cash outlay, it needs to be added, added back in in order to get a true picture of operating cash flows. And again, that's something that you'll see in a minute when we look at formulas for operating cash flows later on in the lecture. Again, as I was mentioning earlier, by lowering taxable income, depreciation and other non-cash expenses, create a tax shield and enhance cash flow. And one of the reasons why MAcRs is an accelerated form of depreciation is that it essentially does have the effect of lowering the amount of taxes a firm needs to pay because the depreciation rates are higher during the years that the item is actually depreciated.

So all that being said, how do we actually calculate depreciation? First, we need to establish a few things. One is that under the basic MAcRs procedures, the depreciable value of an asset is its full cost, including outlays for installation. So you need to include installation costs when you're calculating the depreciable value of an item under MAcRs, under depreciation for tax purposes, no adjustment is required for expected salvage value. That's something that's handled as a gain or a loss when the item is actually sold. So you don't have to take salvage value into consideration when you're figuring out the depreciable value of an item for tax purposes, the depreciable life of an asset is determined by its makers recovery predetermined period. So as you'll see on the next slide, there's actually a number of categories and classifications that are pre determined to determine what appropriate the appropriate value should be used in terms of a depreciation rate for any particular item. So on this slide here, you can see that we have for MAcRs depreciation property classes, there are actually six MAcRs recovery periods, the others are 15 and 20 years. But we don't use those in this course. So we're only going to focus on these recovery periods of three, five, seven and ten years respectively.

And essentially what happens is you take the item once it's been identified as depreciable, and remember, there's those three criteria that it needs to meet in order to be depreciable. But once you've identified a depreciable item, you then take a look and see where does it fit within the MAcRs property classifications so that you can figure out then what depreciation rate you need to take into account in each year that the item is depreciated. Okay. So for instance, items that would go within the three year property class recovery period would include research equipment, certain special tools. In the five year period, we would have computers, typewriters, copiers, duplicating equipment, cars and light trucks and other similar assets. Within the seven year recovery period, we might have office furniture fixtures. Most manufacturing equipment tends to fall within this particular category, railroad track and other items. And within the ten year period, you might have equipment used in petroleum refinery and in the manufacture of tobacco and certain food products. Keep in mind that this is only an illustrative list. A much more comprehensive list is available from the Internal Revenue Service from the IRS. In this course, we'll always tell you which depreciation recovery period you need to use in order to do a particular calculation. So that being said, the MAcRs depreciation rates by asset class are actually displayed here on this screen.

So basically this tells you what rates you need to use if you're depreciating an item that falls within the the three year, five year, seven year or ten year recovery period. Okay. So for items, for instance, that fall within the three year recovery period, you see that in year one of that asset's use, you can depreciate 33% of its depreciable value, which again includes the original purchase price plus the installation costs. In year two, you can depreciate 45% year three, 15%, and in year four, even though it's only in a three year recovery period, there's actually another 7% depreciation that can take place. Okay. So one of the things that you may notice immediately is you actually depreciate an item for one year longer than its recovery period. And the reason we have that is due to something called the half year rule. Okay. You may note that depreciation is actually highest in the second year rather than the first year under MAcRs. And the reason for that is that we use the half year convention and in the first year one half of the otherwise allowable MAcRs is used. Okay. So you don't actually use the full depreciation rate in year one. What you actually use is half. Okay. And the, the actual number that you use here is is displayed here on the screen. Okay. So the reason that this was put into place is that accounts for.

The fact that different assets are put into place at different times during the year. So for that reason, we have the highest depreciation rate actually occurring in year two, and we actually have that little bit extra left over in the year immediately following the assets recovery period. I think the best way to demonstrate how to use the MAcRs depreciation rates is through some basic examples. So we'll look at example one here on the screen and then we'll look at another example in PDF format in a moment. So in this particular example, we have Baker Corporation, which acquired for an installed cost of $40,000 a machine having a recovery period of five years using the applicable MAcRs rates. The depreciation expense for each year is as follows and you can see that the cost, including the installed cost, is going to be $40,000. So that that cost doesn't change because that's fixed at the time you purchase the item, right? We use the original purchase price plus the installation cost then to figure out the amount that you depreciate in each particular year, you have to match, first of all, the item with its recovery period here. We're told that the recovery period is five years, and since it's five years, what you have to do is you go back to the previous slide and you can find all the depreciation rates that you need to plug in there.

So all those depreciation rates, they're all given and they're all constant, they all stay the same. So for any item in three years, you would use the depreciation rates given in that second column of 33, 45, 15 and 7% respectively for five years, you would use the rates given in the next column. And in this case, you'll note that we have an item with a recovery period of five years. So again, going back to that previous table, we use all those rates given within the five year column. So 20%, 32%, 19%, 12, 12 and 5% for recovery years one through six, respectively. So basically what you do then is to figure out the amount that you can depreciate. You take the cost of the item, including its installed cost, including installation costs, Pardon me, and multiply that by the maker's depreciation rate. So for instance, in year one, be 40,000 multiplied by 20% to give you a depreciation of $8,000 Year two, for instance, it would be 32% multiplied by that installed cost of $40,000. This gives you $12,800 and so on. So again, you use those depreciation rates given in the table on the previous slide and multiply those by the installed cost of the asset to figure out the amount that you can depreciate in the applicable year. Note that when you add up all the individual depreciation rates for each individual years, that it comes to the total installed cost of the asset.

So the asset has to be depreciated fully at the end of its life. To help further demonstrate this concept, I did include an example in the course package and I'm just going to very briefly bring that up and go through that as well. Again, this example is in your course package, so you all have a copy of this. In this case, we have a company, Norton Systems, that acquired two assets. Asset A was research equipment costing $17,000 and having a three year recovery period. Asset B was duplicating equipment, having an installed cost of $45,000 and a five year recovery period using MAcRs depreciation percentages. Prepare a depreciation schedule for each of these assets. So first asset, we're told, has a three year recovery period. Okay. So again, that's told directly in the problem. The second asset asset B has a five year recovery period. So the solution is given below asset A, which has a three year recovery period. So the installed cost of the asset is $17,000. And because it's within the three year recovery period, we know that the depreciation is actually accumulated for four years. So I know that seems a little bit counterintuitive, but that is the way that they label these items. The percentages of 33, 45, 15 and 7%. Again, you can get directly from the slides.

Okay. So we go back for three years and you see that we've got 33, 45, 15 and 7% given for those recovery years respectively. Okay. So just to bounce back to the example, you take those numbers, multiply that by the installed cost of the asset and you can figure out the depreciation in each individual year. Again, if you sum up these, it'll come to the installed cost of the asset, in this case, $17,000. So that's one way that you can do a quick check to make sure that you haven't made any mistakes in your calculations. At the end of its depreciable life, the item should be fully depreciated. Asset B, we were told, had a five year recovery period, which means that we use the percentages again given in the table on the slides of 2032 to 1912, 12 and 5% respectively. And in this case, we were also told that the installed cost of the asset is $45,000. Okay? So you take those depreciation rates and multiply by it $45,000. So for instance, in year four, we have a depreciation rate of 12%, multiplying it by the installed cost of $45,000 gives us $5,400. And once again, if you add all these numbers up, it should come to a total of $45,000. And again, that serves as a very useful check. So I do. Encourage you to review those examples, to make sure that you understand how to apply the depreciation rates.

I think that the calculations are fairly straightforward. As long as you recognize which recovery period you have to use and make sure that you don't make any entry errors when you're entering these percentages, it's relatively straightforward to calculate the depreciation for tax purposes under MAcRs. Now, one of the other things, of course, that's key to analyzing a firm's cash flow is being able to interpret the statement of cash flow. And we had a lecture on the statement of cash flow earlier on. And of course that was a relatively short lecture. But one of the reasons that it is relatively short is that many of the components of the statement of cash flow are going to be discussed repeatedly throughout the course. In particular, we're going to focus on inflows and outflows of cash on many occasions throughout the course. And I think that once we gain a better understanding of inflows and outflows of cash throughout the rest of this course, the interpretation of the statement of cash flow will be significantly easier. Just to reiterate a couple of the key points of the statement of cash flow, since we are talking about analyzing a firm's cash flow. Naturally the statement of cash flow ties the beginning and ending balance sheets together during a period. Remember that it also makes use of the income statement and essentially is constructed from two consecutive balance sheets and a firm's income statement for the intervening period.

Recall that it has three sections operating flows which deal with the day to day activities of the firm investment flows, which deal with cash flows associated with fixed assets, investments and financing flows, which essentially deal with debt equity and dividends. The net increase or decrease in cash and marketable securities, of course, should be equivalent to the difference between the cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet at the end of the year and the end of the year. Again, the operating activities plus the investment activities plus the financing activities will give you the net cash flow and will give you a value equivalent to that third bullet point. The operating cash flow and the free cash flow are two other forms of analyzing a firm's cash flow that you need to familiarize yourself with. Operating cash flow is basically the cash from normal operations. Okay, so this is the cash that a firm generates from the production and sale of its goods and services. It's the cash flow again associated with the day to day activities of the firm. Note that there is a difference between the accounting and the finance definitions of cash flow. Okay, this is a very important point. The accounting definition defines cash flow from operations as net profits after taxes plus depreciation. Okay, So once again, the accounting definition of cash flow from operations is defined as the net profits after taxes plus depreciation.

The finance definition of of cash flow is given here on the screen. So the operating cash flow, which again is one, is the finance definition of cash flow, is the Ebit multiplied by one minus the taxes. So t here is the taxes plus the depreciation. Okay. So a little bit different between the accounting and finance definitions of cash flow. And in fact, one of the examples later on in this lecture does give you an illustration of those differences and shows you how to actually calculate the differences between them. Free cash flow is the other cash flow that I very briefly wanted to introduce you to in this lecture. And basically this is the type of cash flow that investors tend to pay the most attention to because it is the amount of cash actually available to them after everything else has been taken care of. Okay. So free cash flow is essentially what's left after you've met all of your operating needs. And then after you've gone and you've made your fixed asset investments and your net current asset investments. Okay, so net fixed asset investments here, which are abbreviated as n f I is equal to the change in net fixed assets plus depreciation. Okay. So that's one of the first things we have to calculate in order to put together our free cash flow and the net current asset investment, which is abbreviated as NCI is defined as the change in CA, which is current assets.

So the change in current assets minus the change in accounts payable, which is a slash P, a slash P is accounts payable and accruals. Okay? And you can see that if you understand what those are, you can then put together the free cash flow formula, which is simply the operating cash flow, which again was calculated on the previous screen minus the Nfai. Okay. So minus the net fixed assets investments and minus the net current assets investments as well. Once again, there is an example in your course package that I want to very briefly refer you to here and we'll bounce over to that just to make sure that everybody knows what I'm talking about. This is entitled OCF and Fcff. And again, what you've been given here is information from in some balance sheets for a particular corporation, and you've also been given some income statement data. Okay. So here you can see that we have balance sheet information from 2005 and 2006 for a particular corporation. And then we also have some limited income statement data that will actually need in order to do the analysis requested in the problem. And then what happens here is, first of all, you're asked to calculate. The firm's accounting cash flow from operations, which again is different than the operating cash flow.

So this example helps demonstrate the difference between the accounting and the finance definitions of cash flow of operating cash flow. Then you're asked to calculate the firm's net operating profits after taxes, the free cash flow, and then to compare and contrast your estimates in the earlier parts. So part A again, remember, deals with the accounting method. So as I was saying earlier, the cash flow from operations equals the net profits after taxes plus depreciation. Under the accounting method of calculating the cash flow from operations. So in this particular case, net profits after taxes is $1,300. Okay. So that's information that was given above and the income statement data and the depreciation is $6,300. And once again, that information is given in the income statement data. So in order to calculate the accounting cash flow from operations, you need to have those two pieces of information from the income statement and you can then find the cash flow from operations to be $3,000. Part B you were asked to calculate the net operating profit after taxes that is equal to the Ebit, the earnings before interest and taxes multiplied by one minus T, which is taxes. Okay. So the net operating profit after taxes again is the Ebit multiplied by one minus the tax rate. In this case, earnings before interest and taxes is $2,700. The tax rate is given is 40%, and you can calculate the nopat to be equal to $6,320.

The operating cash flow is the next thing that you're asked to calculate. And essentially this is the finance definition of cash flow. Okay. So nopat. Okay. Again, that's equal to Ebit multiplied by one minus T, And again, if you look at the formulas on the slides. Okay. So we'll just go back to that very quickly. See that the operating cash flow is the Ebit multiplied by one minus T plus depreciation. So you take that formula, drop it in here, plus plus the depreciation and the operating cash flow comes to be $3,220. Free cash flow, again, you have to take basically the operating cash flow calculated in Part C and subtract from that the net fixed asset investment. How to calculate that is specified below and minus from that, the net current asset investment and again that is specified below here as well. All those numbers have been broken out and the free cash flow should come to approximately $420. In part, you're asked to make a few comments and I'll let you read read those on your own. So that's all I wanted to talk about in today's lecture on analyzing the firm's cash flow. Of course, cash flow is going to be a primary focus throughout the remainder of the course, so we will repeatedly refer return to many of the concepts that we discussed in today's lecture, particularly the notion of inflows and outflows of cash.",5488,"[-0.03051199 -0.00471748  0.00770544 ...  0.0022087  -0.00851858

Time Value of Money,4.2,CEFA,"Title: Time Value of Money; Description: The key takeaways from this video are the concepts of compound interest, timelines, and the use of electronic spreadsheets (specifically Excel) for cost estimation and financial analysis. Compound interest is explained as interest earned not only on the original principal investment but also on the interest earned in prior periods, leading to exponential growth of interest over time. Timelines are introduced as visual representations of cash flows, with cash outflows shown as negative values and cash inflows as positive values. The importance of understanding the time value of money and the use of future value and present value techniques in investment analysis are emphasized. Future value measures cash flows at the end of a project's life, while present value measures cash flows at the start. The video also highlights the flexibility in choosing computational methods for these calculations, with equations and electronic spreadsheets (particularly Excel) being the primary focus of the course. The use of electronic spreadsheets allows for easy sensitivity analysis and the generation of graphs and charts to enhance information communication. The video concludes by introducing the formulas for calculating present value, future value, and annuities, and notes that the next lecture will cover the application of these formulas with examples related to cash inflows and outflows.; Transcript: Well, welcome back. Up to this point in the course, we spent much of our time talking about financial analysis, and we're still going to come back to that material quite a bit throughout the rest of the course. But today we're going to switch gears a little bit and talk about the time value of money. I'm going to start off by introducing you to the concept of the time value of money, which is one of the most important concepts in the course and one of the reasons why it's absolutely essential. All engineers understand this concept is that most financial decisions involve costs and benefits that are spread out over time. So whether you're making investments in new equipment, new processes, inventory, all of these types of things are affected by the time value of money. And for that reason, it's absolutely essential that all engineers know how to do this so that we can make comparisons of cash flows from different periods. After that brief introduction to the time value of money, we're going to talk a little bit about the concept of interest. And then I'm going to very briefly introduce you to some computational methods that are going to be widely used throughout the rest of the course. As we are going throughout today's lecture. It's probably a good idea to keep in mind this key point highlighted in the box here. And this really is one of the most important concepts in the entire course, and that is that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow.

And we're going to see why once we get into today's lecture. So starting things off then as a baseline, we need to establish that money or cash does have a time value and it's measured by interest rate and return on investment in practice. Interest rate and return on investment are often used interchangeably in investment analysis. But it's important to it's important to note that in a narrow sense, interest is reserved for debt and return on investment is reserved for equity. So keep in mind that although debt and equity are different, they are both forms of investment. With that in mind, we use the concept of the time value of money to decide whether to spend money on ways to create value, i.e. whether or not we should make investments in engineering, of course, is crucially affected by decisions about whether to invest in new projects. And for this reason, it's absolutely essential that engineers understand the time value of money and its use in investment analysis, because the time value of money is one of the key factors in how we decide to invest in things. One of the reasons we pay such a close, such close attention to the time value of money is that cash is a valuable asset and it's so valuable people are actually willing to pay to have it available for their use. There's a number of reasons for this. Some of those reasons are summarized here and they include that cash is liquid.

In other words, it doesn't need to be converted into anything else before it can be used, before it can be exchanged for goods and services. You can take your cash into any store and immediately exchange it for another item, provided of course, that you have enough. It's available. It can be used at once, relatively safe. The risk factors are inflation, which we're going to talk about very briefly in a few moments. And government stability. And it's storable so you can put the money under your mattress if you like. You can put it in the bank and then once again, you can have it available for when you need it. Keeping those points in mind, we therefore sell money at a price that offsets liquidity, availability, safety and durability. And like any other commodity, commodity money is subject to the forces of supply and demand. Now, when we're considering the value of money, there's really two perspectives that we need to look at. One is value in the eyes of the lender or investor, and the other is value in the eyes of the borrower. So here we'll first consider value in the eyes of the lender or investor. And the first point we need to establish is that it's important to recognize that people that lend money to others or invest in a company give up some personal flexibility and security. Okay. So remember when somebody lends your company money or when somebody invests in your business, they're essentially deferring their use of the money when they lend it to you.

So they need to they need to get something in return. And what they get in return is usually interest if it is on debt or a return on equity, if we're looking at it from the perspective of an equity investment. Now, everybody's a little different in terms of what they expect to earn on any investment they make into a company or any money that they lend to another. And the time value of money is specific for each investment. So it does change depending on the investment. It does change depending on the potential project that it's going to be invested in. It may change depending on who you're borrowing it from as well, because that time value of money reflects a number of different factors and again, these factors may vary over time and may vary from project to project. So some of them are listed here. The first one that I wanted to note is inflation, and we briefly mentioned inflation earlier on. And basically inflation is the principle that the purchasing power of money and its ability to be traded for things of real value, like a loaf of bread or a liter of gasoline generally reduces over time. So, for example, in 1968, perhaps you could buy a Corvette for 3 or $4000. That's probably not the case now, okay? Unless it's it's one that's not in very good shape. With that in mind, then the interest rate must be higher at an absolute minimum than the perceived rate of inflation by a certain amount.

If any thinking person is to become a lender. And again, inflation is one of the key reasons why we know a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. Another factor that investors or lenders will take into account is the general supply and demand of money. Risk is certainly another big one. And this for me. Is always one of the big ones because it deals with the question, how likely am I to get my money back? So if you're making a relatively risky investment, then you would expect probably a higher rate of return in order to compensate you for assuming that additional risk. Liquidity is the fourth. Fourth reason that we have and again, liquidity basically deals with how easily an investment can be turned back into cash. In any case, anybody lending money or investing in a company is generally interested in increasing their wealth. And we should always keep that in mind when we are borrowing money or whenever we're accepting money on an equity basis from a potential owner of a firm. The other perspective that we need to look at is value in the eyes of the borrower. And basically there's two broad reasons for borrowing. One is for personal expenditure and the other is for attempting to create more commercial value. So first point, some borrowing is for personal and non-monetary values.

For example, we may take out mortgages on personal homes because we want to raise children in a house, not an apartment. Maybe you like it because it's more quiet. You don't have to worry about neighbors or people walking around above you. You may want to buy a car, and it's so important that you don't want to defer, you know, actually acquiring that asset that you're actually willing to pay interest on the cash that you need in order to purchase that home or car or whatever the case may be. So that's the first reason, personal, personal borrowing. The second is commercial borrowing. And this is always based on the belief that the borrower can create value at a higher rate than the cost of money, thus creating value that can be retained by the borrower. Okay, so if you're a company borrowing money, remember, in order to make money, you have to earn not only a return high enough to cover that interest rate that you must pay and to pay back the principal, but you have to earn more so that you can actually retain some of that, some of that value. And really, that's the purpose. The whole objective of most commercial borrowing is, again, to increase wealth. Now, one of the key determinants of value is this notion of interest. And the concept of interest basically states that in every time period, whether it's a month or a year or potentially even a week, the cash put into an investment must yield some return.

In other words, it must return some value in addition to the original amount of the loan. And stated another way interest is essentially the fee for using someone else's property, in this case cash. Now there's two main types of interest that we're going to look at in this course. One is simple interest, and this is basically computed only on the original sum and not on the accrued interest. The other is compound interest and simple interest is very rarely used. Compound interest is the type of interest that we use for the most part in this course, and you can assume that we're using it unless we state specifically otherwise. Basically, compound interest is when both the principal and the prior periods interest earns interest in the current period. In other words, it may be thought of is interest on top of interest. I think the best way to explain and demonstrate the principles of simple and compound interest is through a basic example. So we're going to look at a couple of basic examples here on the screen, and then I'm going to very briefly pull you over to some Excel files, which again you have available in your course package. And this will be the first time that we look at Excel to again demonstrate this principle of simple interest versus compound interest with simple interest. Recall that you don't earn interest on the interest. So, for instance, if we earn 5%, 5% interest on an investment of $100, that means you're going to earn $5 in each time period.

So you can see, for instance, 5%, of course, of $100 is 5%. Whether the investment is in year one, two, three, 4 or 5, we're going to be earning an interest of 5% or $5 pardon me, 5% of the original amount in that particular time period. Compound interest, however, you actually earn interest on top of interest. And for that reason, compound interest is actually higher than simple interest. So if you look at at this screen here, you'll see that in year one, we're earning 5% of $100, $100 being the original amount of the investment in this case, that would be $5 of interest. However, in year two, you actually earn more than $5. And the reason for that is that we're earning interest not only on the original $100 deposit, but also on the $5 of interest that we earned in the previous time period. So that would mean in year two, we're actually earning 525 of interest. We're earning 5% of $105. Likewise, in three years in year three, pardon me, we would earn 5% on the amount accumulated at the end of year two, which would in this case is $110.25. Therefore, we'd earn interest of $5.51 in year three, rather than just the basic $5 that we would earn by simple interest and so on. Now, as I said, we also have an example of simple versus compound interest available in Excel. And again, you have all of these spreadsheets in your course package.

So I always encourage you to take a look at all the examples that I've been provided. They are very important for learning the material in this course and in particular many of the Excel examples that I've prepared in the course package I think will really help you learn how to use Excel and do many of the calculations that you need to learn in order to complete this. Course. So the first example we have here is a very basic one. Okay? This is a simple versus compound interest and again is our first introduction to Excel. Now, if you haven't used Excel before, that's okay. We're going to use it quite a bit throughout this course. So you will become fairly familiar with it. And if if you do need additional help, you can always find more information in the help function in Excel, which has been greatly improved over the last couple of versions of Excel. And there's a lot of information in there that explains how to use this spreadsheet program. That being said, I will show you how to use the functions that you need to learn for this particular course. So in this case, just taking a look again at simple versus compound interest, you can see in this case we have an initial investment of $1,000. Okay. So I've entered a value of $1,000 in that particular cell and interest rate of 4%. Okay. Again, entered in the cell to calculate the simple interest.

We know, again, that the interest is simply going to be the same. It's going to be 4% of the initial investment over the entire course of that particular investment. So 4% of 1000 is $40 the way that I calculated that. Of course, that's a very simple calculation and you can do it in your head, but if you want to do it using Excel, the formula to do that, if you click on that particular cell, is always going to be displayed up here in this function bar. Okay, so you may be familiar with such bars. It's very similar to something like an Internet search engine. You can see here any of the formulas for any of these particular cells. Okay. If you click on any of the cells is always available in this top portion. Okay? So you can click on any of those cells and you can always see the formula which tells you how that value for that particular cell was calculated. So again, I do encourage you to review the Excel spreadsheets that you've been provided in the course package. So coming back to the original point, then 4% of 1000, you just go equal the value in this cell, which is 4%. Multiply that by 1000 and you would get $40. Of course, the interest rate is going to be the same for each year and therefore we can see the total amount of our investment basically being the original amount plus all the accumulated interest for compound interest.

Remember, the interest actually is compounded on top of the interest in addition to the principal. Okay. You can see the calculations for that once again have been provided here in Excel. But the basic idea is for the first year, of course, you would take 4% of the original amount of the loan to calculate the interest. That would give us a total of $1,000 plus the $40 in interest for a total value of our investment of 1040. But to compute the interest in the second year and in subsequent years, you have to compute interest on this total from the previous year. Okay, so that includes the principal and the previous period's interest. So in this case it would be 4%. Okay, I'm clicking on this cell. You can see when you look up at this value, you'll see it says B7, which refers to this column column B, row seven. That's the 4% interest that we've entered there. Okay. So rather than just typing in 4%, we can actually reference this cell, which makes things very convenient and a lot easier when you're doing complicated calculations, as you'll see when we get into this course. So that's the 4% multiplied by C 21. So C is again column C and 21, you'll notice is that value from the previous period year? Okay. So to calculate the interest, it's the 4% multiplied by the sum of the interest in the principal from the previous year, that gives us 4160.

Once again, we add this to the previous total to get our our new total at the end of year two and you continue in a similar fashion. So once again, I do encourage you to take a look at those formulas in Excel. I recognize it may be a little tough to see some of the individual formulas on the screen, but once again, you always have a copy of all the examples that I'll do in the course in the course package. So let's go back to the PowerPoint slides. That gives you a very brief introduction to the notion of simple and compound interest. And because we expect to earn a return on our investment through interest or through a return on our investment, we know that a dollar today will be worth more than a dollar in the future because if you lend or invest it, you expect to create value. And once again, that comes back to that key point that we highlighted on the very first slide of this lecture and stated another way that essentially means that money that the firm has in its possession today is more valuable than money in the future because the money it has now can be invested to earn positive reviews. And likewise, the opposite of that is a future dollar is worth less today because you can invest less today and have that future dollar again due to the fact that we expect to earn a return on on those investments.

Now.

Once we understand that money has a time value, we need to learn how to apply that concept. And financial decisions can be assessed by using what we call either future value or present value techniques. Although they both result in the same decision, they do view it differently. Future value essentially measures the cash flows at the end of a project's life, while present value essentially does so at the start, or what we usually call time zero. Okay, Present value and future value techniques are absolutely essential concepts in all investment analysis. And you're going to see that we make very frequent use of these concepts throughout the rest of the course. Future value basically deals with compounding or growth over time. Present value deals with discounting to today's value. And basically these present and future values concepts can be used to calculate the value of single cash flows and series of cash flows. So we can consider both singles, single cash flows and series of cash flows over a period of time and relate them in either future value or present value terms. And again, we're going to see that in many, many examples throughout the remainder of this course. In any case, to help illustrate these relationships and to help show the value of cash flows occurring at particular periods of time, typically we use something called timelines and timelines. Basically allow us to give a visual presentation of inflows and outflows of cash. Okay, Once again, outflows of cash are treated as negatives, and inflows of cash are treated as positives.

Okay. So if you look at the timeline, essentially what you have is a certain period of time and it could be months, it could be weeks. In this case, it's years. Okay. So we have zero one, two, three, four and five times zero. Always represents or generally represents, pardon me, the current date it represents now. Okay. So unless specifically stated otherwise. Times zero represents. Now we'll look at a couple of other cases later on in the course where time zero may not necessarily be today, for example, it may be the start of production or some other time in the future. But in general always make the basic assumption that time zero is now unless you're told otherwise. So typically what you have in order to get a project going is you have some sort of cash outflow. So in this case, we've got a cash outflow of $10,000 and is represented as -10,000 on the timeline. And this cash outflow basically results in a number of cash inflows over a period of time. Of course, those cash inflows could change depending on the year. They could continue for a different number of periods. In this case, we're saying that this initial $10,000 investment yields cash inflows of three, five, four, three and 2000 respectively at the end of years one through five. When we're putting together these timelines and we're talking about cash flows and cash inflows and cash outflows generally, the convention is that we assume that money is realized at the end of the period.

This is true for loans and it's close enough what we say close enough for cash flow calculations. So for cash flows, of course, we know that generally they flow in over the course of the year. Okay. They don't necessarily all come in one big block or one big blob at the very end of the year. But generally the impact of the cash flowing in over the course of the year is usually ignored since the error associated with this assumption is typically very small compared to the assumptions used to generate the cash flow forecasts. Okay. So generally speaking, we'll assume that money is realized at the end of the period unless we specifically state otherwise. Now, taking the figure on the on the previous slide a little bit further. Okay. So taking that timeline a little bit further, you can see that we can actually build on that timeline to build in the the future value and present value these notions of compounding and discounting. Okay. So recall essentially that the the principle of future value measures, the cash flows at the end of a project's life. Okay? So you can see that we take all those cash flows between time zero up to time five, and we can basically bring them forward to figure out the future value of all of those cash flows at the end of year five. Okay. Present value basically involves discounting. So likewise, we can take all those cash flows occurring between time zero one, two, three, four and five, and we can resolve them to an equivalent amount in today's dollars.

Essentially, that's what the present value does and that's what this figure does, does try to show, okay, So it shows that you can take all those cash flows and resolve them to an equivalent amount in the future. And likewise, you can take all those cash flows and resolve them to an equivalent amount in today's in today's dollars. So the timeline is used to help set up the problem. And just give us a sense of the various cash inflows and cash outflows associated with any particular investment in order to actually do the compounding or discounting in order to actually compute the future value or present value of all those cash flows, we need to do some computational analysis. And there are several established methods used to complete calculations related to the time value of money equations, financial tables, financial calculators and electronic spreadsheets are the main or the main methods used to do future value and present value computations. Our focus in this course is going to be on equations and electronic spreadsheet methods. I'm going to very. Briefly review the other methods. That being said, I'm not going to heavily emphasize them throughout the course. That being said, you can use any method that you want. Okay, so for the tests you can use any of these methods to solve. But that being said, I am going to very heavily emphasize the use of the equations and spreadsheets in this course and hopefully that'll be clear once we get into these discussions.

So just a very briefly introduce you to the other methods so that you are familiar with them. The first method is the financial tables method and basically financial tables that contain various interest factors used in computations are available in most engineering economics or financial management textbooks. Basically, what you do in this form of computation is you go to the appropriate table, look up a factor using both the period and the interest rate. So in this case, you can see we're looking up a value for an interest factor occurring at an interest rate of 20% and a time period of ten periods. And then basically you can use these in the computations to do your future value and present value analysis. Now, in some of the example problems and homework problems in the course package, I've done some of those calculations so that you can see how they're done and how they're put together. But I don't emphasize these for a couple of reasons. One is that the tables, of course, aren't going to have the factor for every single interest rate or every single time period, and they may require interpolation. Okay, So there's a bit of extra work associated with that. The second reason is that they're less precise than the electronic spreadsheet or calculator based methods. Okay, So they are less precise for some problems.

They're a little bit easier or a little bit quicker to do the calculations. But in general, the other disadvantage is that they're not particularly conducive to sensitivity analysis. Okay? Electronic spreadsheets in particular are very good for conducting spreadsheet spreadsheet analyses that the financial tables really aren't. Okay. So yes, doing calculations, using the financial tables and the interest factors associated with them is perfectly valid. You can do those if you choose to. And there are some examples in the in the course package in both the homework and the examples. But that being said, I'm not going to talk about these very often throughout the remainder of the course, with a couple of exceptions. Once in a while we'll talk about them very briefly. Financial calculators are the second method that you can use to do future value and present value computations. Basically, in this case, what you do is you if you have a number of knowns, you can plug those into your calculator and solve for some unknown. Okay. All that being said, you do not need a financial calculator in this course. If you have one, you can certainly use it, but it's not required. Okay. What we tend to emphasize and what I'm going to talk about for the most part in all of the lectures from here on out is the electronic spreadsheets method. In particular, I'm going to focus on Excel, since it is by far the most widely used electronic spreadsheet on the market.

A number of reasons why I tend to emphasize electronic spreadsheets are summarized here. One is that spreadsheets go far beyond the computational abilities of calculators. They have abilities to program logical decisions. They can display not only the calculated values of solutions, but also the input conditions on which the solutions are based. In other words, they permit an easy sensitivity analysis, And for me, this is the big one. Okay? Spreadsheets are very, very useful for conducting sensitivity analyses and doing calculations very quickly. What if type questions are very easy to ask and the reality is in practice, you're going to have to do a sensitivity analysis for almost all types of calculations that you do. So typically you're not going to be asked just to do one calculation. You're going to do a most likely estimate. You might do a pessimistic, you might do an optimistic estimate, you might do a whole variety of estimates dealing with different lifetimes of the project, dealing with different interest rates and different cash flows. So there's all kinds of sensitivity analyses that are typically required in real life calculations and spreadsheets are far easier to or far better, I think, for accommodating those types of calculations than either calculators and in particular the financial tables. Of course, spreadsheet programs are also very good for generating graphs and charts to help communicate information, and this is also a very useful feature. Sometimes it gets old looking at a lot of numbers and it's very easy to be overwhelmed by numbers, so it may be easier to present the information in a chart or a table.

And of course Excel has that capability and is relatively easy to use to generate graphs and charts to enhance the communication of that information. Now, regardless of which method you use, whether it's the financial tables, the calculator method or the electronic spreadsheet method, these methods are basically used to calculate the value of different patterns of cash flow. Okay? And the cash inflows and outflows of a firm can be described by its general pattern. There's three basic patterns that we're going to look at. One is a single amount. One is an annuity and the other is the financial or pardon me, a mixed stream. A single amount basically is a lump sum. So you can see in this case, you have one cash inflow or one cash outflow. That's it. That's all a single amount is. And single amounts, of course, are the easiest types of calculations to do. That being said, if you're using an electronic spreadsheet, really it's not any more difficult to do an annuity or a mixed flow cash stream either. An annuity is basically a level periodic stream of cash flow. Note that it does not necessarily have to be annual. It just has to be periodic. You could also have a monthly annuity, for instance, but in this case you see that we have a $1,500 payment in each year. So that change that that amount doesn't change. It stays the same over a particular period of time.

Mixed cash flow stream is a stream of cash flow that's not an annuity. Okay. So it's a stream of unequal periodic cash flows that reflects no particular pattern. So in this case, I just plugged in some numbers. They could be just about anything. The good thing about the calculations that we're going to learn in this course using Excel is you can calculate the present value of the future value of any of these types of cash flows very easily. So it doesn't matter if it's a mixed cash flow stream. It's still very easy to do these calculations in Excel. Doing mixed flow or mixed cash flow streams calculations using the financial tables in particular is pretty time consuming. But with with Microsoft Excel or another spreadsheet, it is it is fairly convenient to do these types of calculations. Now, once you get into the actual calculations, it's important to familiarize yourself with some notation and here's some basic notation for the time value associated with the time value of money calculations. Pv basically represents the present value or beginning amount. You note that there's a little subscript there. A zero times zero usually represents today, but not necessarily. Again, for the most part, you can assume that it represents today in less specifically stated otherwise in this course. I is the interest rate. Okay. F v is the future value at the end of n periods. You'll note once again we have a little superscript there on n.

N. Is the number of compounding periods and a is an annuity which once again represents a series of equal payments or receipts. Now you're going to be seeing this notation a lot over the rest of the course so you don't have to worry about sitting down and trying to commit this to memory at any time. But in particular, you'll see that we use the present value, the future value calculations. And of course, in order to do those calculations, you need to have your interest rate and your number of compounding periods. The last thing that I wanted to mention in this lecture is to give you the basic formulas for actually doing these calculations, for actually putting together your computations on present value and future value in particular. The first two formulas are probably the most important in the course. They are going to be used repeatedly throughout all of our time value calculations and also throughout the capital budgeting type calculations that we'll do later on in the course. The future value is basically calculated as the present value multiplied by one plus I to the n remember I is equal to the interest rate and n is equal to the number of compound periods. So once again, future value is the present value multiplied by one plus I to the n it takes into account compounding interest. Okay. Now you can also express the future value formula using the interest factors. And that's what those formulas are on the far right hand side of the screen.

Okay. So you could use the present value and then multiply it by a certain interest factor, which you get from one of those tables in either an engineering economics or a financial textbook for a certain interest rate and for a certain number of compounding periods. And I've included that here. Just for completeness, once again, you can use them if you choose to do so. But I'm going to tend to emphasize these formulas on the left part of the screen here. Okay, so future value is present value multiplied by one plus I to the N present value is essentially the future value divided by one plus I to the N. Okay, so future value naturally is going to be less present value. Part of me is going to be less than the future value because we're discounting using a certain interest rate over a certain number of time periods. I've also included the formulas for the future value of an annuity and the present value of an annuity as well. Those formulas are a little bit more involved and you can read them here on the screen. Now in the next lecture, we're going to learn how to apply each of those formulas, and we're going to look at several examples that illustrate how you can use the future value interest formula and how you can use the present value formula as well to make computations pertaining to inflows and outflows of cash.",7098,"[-0.02000344 -0.01349247  0.01641732 ... -0.02708667 -0.0096075

Risk and Return,5.0,CEFA,"Title: Risk and Return; Description: In this video, the instructor introduces the concepts of risk and return in investment analysis, emphasizing the need to consider risk when assessing investments. The instructor distinguishes risk from uncertainty and categorizes the sources of risk into firm-specific risks, shareholder-specific risks, and firm and shareholder risks. The video also discusses different risk preferences and how they can affect investment decisions. The instructor highlights the importance of understanding the concept of return, which is closely related to risk in the investment context. The second video focuses on calculating the return on an investment using a specific formula and provides an example with two investments to illustrate this calculation. The video also introduces sensitivity analysis and probability distribution as tools to assess the variability and likelihood of different outcomes in cost estimation and financial analysis. The third video explores the calculation of standard deviation and its application in determining the risk associated with different assets. The concept of coefficient of variation is introduced as a measure of relative dispersion. Historical returns data is used to illustrate the relationship between risk and return for various types of investments. The video concludes by mentioning that risk and return will be further explored in subsequent lectures, specifically in relation to portfolio risk and return. Overall, these videos provide an introductory understanding of risk and return and their significance in investment analysis.; Transcript: Greetings. In this lecture, we're going to introduce two of the underlying themes throughout much of the remainder of this course, the concepts of risk and return. Specifically, what we're going to look at is risk and return fundamentals. I'll very briefly introduce you to these concepts. Then we'll talk a little bit about risk assessment and risk measurement as we're going through this. It's very important to remember that risk must be taken into account in all investment analysis. Okay. So in order to maximize share price, all financial managers, all engineering managers and really all engineers need to learn how to assess these two key determinants of risk and return, because they're going to play very important roles, very huge roles, really, in the acceptability of any investment. Okay. When we say risk and we're going to talk about this more throughout the lecture, but maybe just to introduce you to the concept, there's always a chance that a project will not achieve the assumed cash flows or that it might even be a complete failure. Okay. So things don't always turn out the way that we think they're going to. And essentially risk can be thought of as the chance of getting an outcome other than the expected value with an emphasis on something negative. Okay. So risk, again, is something that we're going to talk about throughout the rest of this lecture and in the subsequent lecture as well. And it's something that's going to come up periodically throughout the remainder of the course.

Of course, if everyone knew ahead of time how much a stock would sell for sometime in the future or how much cash flow a particular project would earn over a period of time, investing would be a very simple endeavor, but of course that's not always the case. In the case of stocks, stock prices will fluctuate whether we like it or not. And in the case of projects, the cash flow is always going to change as well. It's always going to probably be a little bit different than what we thought it would be years prior to the cash flow actually occurring. So therefore, it's really it's difficult, if not impossible to make any predictions like this with any degree of certainty. And really precise price movement is very difficult to predict. As a result, investors often use history as a basis for predicting the future. As we know that history isn't necessarily always the best indication of what's going to happen in the in the future, but that doesn't mean it isn't something that we can't use and we can't learn from. And with that in mind, we're going to begin this module by evaluating risk and return characteristics of individual assets. And then we're going to end by looking at portfolios of assets. Okay. So in this particular lecture, we're going to look at single assets, we'll look at risk and return from the perspective of single assets. And in the subsequent lecture, in the next lecture, we're going to look at the at risk and return from a portfolio perspective.

So what do we mean by risk in the context of business and finance? Risk is defined as the chance of suffering a financial loss. Assets, okay. Whether they're real or financial, which have a greater chance of loss, are considered more risky than those with a lower chance of loss. And that's something that seems to make sense. But maybe to give you just a little bit more formal definition of what risk is, more formally risk is really the product of likelihood and consequence. Okay. So whenever you're thinking about risk, it may be useful to structure your risk assessment around these three key questions. What can go wrong? How likely is it and what are the consequences? Okay, so whenever we're thinking about risk again, it's really that chance of suffering a financial loss in this case. And when we're taking that into account, we need to look at both the likelihood and the consequence. So therefore, we have to ask ourselves all the things that can go wrong. How likely is it? And then what are the consequences of this particular occurrence happening? Once we've done that, then we can begin our risk management process. We can begin identifying, evaluating and implementing actions to prevent or reduce risk. One of the other things that I want to mention before we get too deep into the discussion of risk is the notion of risk versus uncertainty.

Many textbooks do assume that risk may be used interchangeably with the term uncertainty. When we're referring to the variability of returns associated with a given asset. However, I do want to note that in a in a technical sense, that's probably not correct. Risk basically refers to situations where the probability is known. Uncertainty refers to situations where probabilities are unknown. Okay, So keep that in mind in some textbooks or papers, you may see that some people will use these interchangeably, others may use it using the more formal definitions that I've just given. Where risk is, where the probability is known and uncertainty is where the probabilities are unknown. In any case, when thinking about risk, I think it's often useful to think about it in terms of categories, and the sources of risk here are divided into three broad categories the firm, the shareholder and beyond. So for firm, specific risks, we have two risks. We have business risk and we have financial risk. Essentially, business risk is the risk of being unable to cover operating costs. So it's that risk associated with the day to day operations of your business. Financial risk is the risk that you'll be unable to meet financial financial obligations. So things like making interest payments on debt that you've borrowed, shareholders specific risks include interest rate risk, which is essentially the risk that changes in interest rates may affect investment value. And that's something that you can see by looking at the the future value or present value equations that we've looked at, changes in interest rates have.

Very serious implications for the value of any particular investment. Liquidity risk is basically the chance that a particular investment cannot be easily, easily, easily liquidated at a fair price. And then we have market risk, which is basically external factors associated with the economy or politics, more broad factors. Lastly, we have firm and shareholder risks. Something like an event risk, which could include a disaster or a change in government regulation that may affect investment value. Exchange rate risk. Basically the risk that if particularly for those companies that are dealing in internationally and dealing with multiple currencies, of course, the relative value of currencies are constantly changing. Purchasing power risk basically deals with the concept of inflation and deflation and tax risk. Basically the risk that there will be a change in the tax scheme. I think it's also useful to keep in mind the risk preferences of the firm when evaluating investments, since this can have a very important investment implications. As you can see here on the screen, basically we've got three different situations. When we're talking about risk preferences. We've got risk averse, risk indifferent and risk seeking. In the center of the of the figure, we have the risk indifference scenario. And this basically is a situation where the required return increase for an increase in or pardon me, where the required return does not change with the risk.

And obviously this is incredibly rare to say the least. Most people, when risk goes up, they would expect an increase in return. And that's basically the situation that we have with risk aversion or risk averse, the risk averse scenario. In that case, the risk, the required return increases for an increase in risk. And by far this is most common. And you should always assume that firms are operating under the principle of risk aversion, at least initially. Just for completeness, I wanted to also cover the risk seeking preference. Basically, this is a situation where the required return decreases for an increase in risk. And theoretically, because they enjoy risk, managers might be willing to give up some some return in order to take more risk. But obviously very rarely does this type of benefit or this this type of behavior benefit the firm. And again, remember that most shareholders are risk averse and for a given increase in risk, they require an increase in the return on their investment. I think that's pretty much common sense. So that's a very brief introduction to risk. And clearly we also need to understand the concept of return, since the relationship between them is so key to this notion of investment. Return basically represents the total gain or loss on an investment over a given period of time, and it's represented in the formula here on the screen. Okay.

So you can see that the actual required or expected return during a particular period represented by Kate is equal to the current price, which is p t minus the price during the previous time period. That's p t minus one plus any cash flow accruing from the investment all divided by p t minus one. Okay. So one of the key points that you might want to take away from that formula right away is that return is realized from both growth in the value of the investment and cash flow. Okay. Those are really the two ways that you can increase risk. One is through growth in the value of the investment and the other is through any cash flows arising from that investment. To demonstrate the application of that return formula, we have a very basic example here on the screen. And basically we've been asked to calculate the expected rate of return on investments X and Y in this scenario, assuming that they are equally risky, which one do you recommend and why? Okay. We're given information pertaining to the market value at time p t minus one, which is the price during the previous time period. Again, we know that from the nomenclature on the previous screen investment ex is 20,000. Investment y is significantly higher at 55,000. Cash flow from the investment is $1,500 for investment x and 6800 for investment y. Finally, the market value at time T, which is the current price for investment X is $21,000.

And for investment Y it's the same. It's exactly the same as it was in the previous time period, $55,000. So basically in order to calculate the required return on these investments, it's a relatively straightforward plug in to the formula on a couple of slides ago. Right? So all we do is we take the formula from this form, from this screen here. So that's the formula for return. And we simply plug in the values to figure out the return for investments X and Y. So investment X, for instance. Okay. The first thing that we need to do is that P t value, that's the current price that's given is $21,000 on the table in the previous slide, -$20,000. That's the market price during the previous time period. So that's basically the growth over this period of time in the value of the investment plus the cash flow of thousand $500. Okay. So this formula explicitly takes into account both the growth in the value of the investment and the cash flow from the previous time period. And then we divide all that by the the market value at the previous time period, and that comes to 12.5% for investment X investment Y, the exact same calculation you can see in this case there wasn't actually any. Growth in the value of the investment. So the only, the only return was realized from the cash flow occurring over that time period of $6,800. And investment wise, return came in slightly lower than investment ex at 12.36%.

And generally speaking, if investors are looking for higher rates of return, then investment X would be preferable. Now of course we'd have to take into account also the different investment levels required here. Clearly investment y would require a higher investment given that its value is significantly higher. But purely on a return basis, we would choose Investment X, given that its return is higher. Now to give you further practice using that formula, I did prepare an example that is included in your course package. Okay, it's entitled Return calculations, and I'm not going to go through each of these individually, individually, but basically this is all giving you practice on applying that that formula on the previous screen. Okay. So for each of the investments shown in the following table, calculate the rate of return earned over the an unspecified time period. We have cash flow during the period. We have the beginning of period value, we have the end of period value and we have investments A, B, C, D and E, And although the numbers may appear a little bit more complex than what we had in the previous example, it's really the same simple formula. Okay, So all we're doing is we're applying this formula here, the, the formula to calculate the return. I'm not going to go through each of these individual numbers. You can see how to put this together on your own, but it will give you a bit more practice just applying that formula if you feel that you would benefit from that.

Now, to give you an idea of the historical investment returns, I wanted to talk just very briefly about this table because I think it does help provide some insight into the risk return relationship from a very practical perspective. Of course, investments vary both over time and between different types of investments By averaging historical returns over a very long period of time, however, it becomes possible to eliminate the impact of market and other types of risk. And therefore we can look at that relationship between risk and return. Okay. So you can see in this example we've got the historical returns for selected investments over a very long period of time between 1926 and 2003. You can see that we have investments for large company stocks, small company stocks, long term government bonds and corporate bonds, US Treasury bills and inflation. The average annual return is given in a percentage. And there's just a couple of things that I wanted to highlight on this on this table. First is that you see the highest risk is associated with small company stocks. Okay? That's something that would make sense if we're looking at the principle of risk aversion. Okay. Typically, small company stocks are the riskiest investment in this in this particular series of classifications. Okay. Large companies are generally a little bit less risky than small companies.

But at the same time, small companies over a very long period of time have tended to have a higher historical return. And again, the reason for that is they're riskier. Okay. So for higher risk, you would expect a higher level of return for bonds. Of course, bonds are going to be significantly lower in terms of return than stocks in general because they're less risky. And we're going to talk about the reason why bonds are less riskier than stocks in a later lecture. But the key reason is that bonds are debt, stocks are equity, and debt is generally less riskier than than equity because payments or obligations with associated with debt must be met before any payments can be made to equity holders. Okay. And we're going to come back to that point later on in the course. But for now, it's important to recognize just that debt is less risky than equity in general, and bonds are associated with debt. Stocks are associated with equity. Us Treasury bills have a very low level of return. It's only 3.8%. And the reason for that is they have virtually no risk. Okay. There's virtually no chance that the United States government is going to default on its obligations associated with Treasury bills. Okay. So for that reason, they have a relatively low level of return. But note that even their level of return is higher than inflation. Okay? Any investment must be above the rate of inflation as an absolute minimum.

Okay. That's the absolute minimum that you would want to earn on any investment. If you're earning less than the rate of inflation, then you're actually losing money on your investment. Okay? So as an absolute base, you have to earn more than that. And you can see that all of these investments on average do okay. Remember, this is for averages. Keep in mind that many small companies, for instance, failed, okay? And they would have had negative annual returns in some years. Same thing for large company stocks. Okay. We're only looking at the the averages here. So let's go back to risk for a moment and we'll start by looking at the risk of single assets. Okay. And when we're looking at risk assessment, again, the three key questions that we need to ask ourselves is what can go wrong? How likely is it and what are the consequences? To help answer these questions, we can use sensitivity and probability analysis. Okay, so sensitivity analysis and probability distributions can be used to assess the general level of risk embodied in a given asset sensitively. Analysis basically uses several possible return estimates to obtain a sense of the variability among the outcomes. Probability distribution is basically a model that relates probabilities to associated associated outcomes. Continuous probability distribution is basically a distribution showing all the possible outcomes and associated probabilities for a given event. So we're going to look at a couple of examples in a bit more detail on sensitivity analysis and probability distribution over the next few slides.

And we'll start off with sensitivity analysis. So we'll begin with a very basic example. In this case, we have a custom golf equipment manufacturer, a Norman company that wants to choose the better of two investment A and B each requires an initial outlay of $10,000, and each has a most likely annual return of 15%. Management has made pessimistic and optimistic estimates of the returns associated with each. Keep in mind that whenever you're doing an analysis, you're going to tend to make these pessimistic or optimistic estimates. And really these this variety of estimates is the the bedrock of sensitivity analysis. The three estimates for each asset, along with its range, is given in the next slide and which asset appears to be less risky. So if we take a look at the next slide, you can see that we've been given initial investments for asset A and asset B of $10,000. So it's the same for each of them, but we have different rates of return. So we've got a most likely return of 15% for both of them, which is the same. But we can see that the pessimistic and optimistic are quite a bit different for assets A and B, So Asset A has a 13% and 17% pessimistic and optimistic estimate respectively, whereas assets B are 7% and 23% for their pessimistic and optimistic estimates respectively. Okay.

So based on this, we can then calculate the range of these estimates. Okay. So all you basically do is you take the optimistic and you subtract from the pessimistic, you take the highest and you subtract from that the lowest to get the range. So in this case, it's 17 -13%, gives you a range of 4% for A and 23 minus seven gives you a range of 16% for B. For this reason, we say that asset A appears to be less risky than A because it has a lower range. Okay. And and the reason that lower range is said to be less risky is that there's less variability in the in the possible levels of return. So range is just one very basic measure of risk, and it indicates basically that it's tougher to identify the likelihood of something going according to plan if your range is higher in the case of asset B rather than asset A. Now, I did prepare a very basic example in your course package on risk analysis that deals with the computation of range and talking a little bit about range. I'm not going to go through that in class. I think it is it's relatively straightforward, but at the same time, I do encourage you to go through that because it does give you a bit more practice in calculating ranges for a couple of of situations and also gives you some practice thinking about what those numbers mean. So sensitivity analysis is one common means for assessing risk.

Recall that, the other is probability distribution and you'll see that in practice we actually combine them once we get into some examples a bit later on. Probability distributions are basically useful for graphically depicting the likelihood of a situation occurring as we're going to see in a few slides. The probabilities can be taken into account in a risk calculation and I think it's a little bit more sophisticated than simply taking the range into account. The two scenarios that we have in these probability distribution analysis are, first of all, discrete. Okay, So discrete probability distributions which are displayed on the on the screen here. And the second is continuous probability distributions. Okay? So for discrete probability, for discrete probability distributions, we basically have a limited number of outcomes and for continuous probability distributions, this is basically situations where we know all the possible outcomes and associated probabilities, and I think that continuous probability distributions are probably most useful for a very large number of outcomes. Now the most common statistical indicator of an asset's risk is something that we call standard deviation. Okay, So yes, we can use range to get a very quick sense of of how risky an asset is. But a much more sophisticated method is this standard deviation. And what we're going to look at later on, the coefficient of variation, standard deviation measures, the dispersion around the expected value and it makes use of probabilities.

Okay. So we basically combine probabilities with the sensitivity analysis and you're going to see that in the example on the following slide. The expected value of a return K bar is the most likely return of an asset, and that's something that we need in order to calculate the standard deviation. Okay. So the first step in calculating the standard deviation is calculating this K bar value. Okay. So before we can do anything else, we have to calculate the expected, the expected value of a return. Now, if the probability and returns are known, it's relatively easy to calculate. Bar using the formula displayed in the center of the screen here. Okay. So you can see that we've got the formula for K bar here and we can actually use that formula to calculate the expected value of returns as we do in this example here. Okay. So we've got two situations here. We've got asset A, we've got asset B, we've got pessimistic, most likely and optimistic estimates for their returns of 1315 and 17% for asset A 715 and 23% for asset B, And then we've got some probabilities associated with the likelihood of those returns occurring. Okay. So for instance, in Asset A, we think there's a 25% chance that a 13% return will occur. We think that there's a 50% chance that a 15% return will occur. And we think that there's a 25% chance that a 17% chance will occur. Okay. So we've got the probabilities and we've got the returns.

Now, to calculate the K bar value, essentially what you'd have to do is calculate a weighted average of these returns. Okay, Taking into account the probabilities. So what you do is you take the probability, you multiply it by the the return, and that gives you a certain value for both the pessimistic or for all of the pessimistic, most likely and optimistic calculations. So for instance, 0.5 multiplied by 15% is 7.5%. And that's how we calculated the most likely weighted value for asset A, And then you calculate that for the pessimistic, most likely and optimistic weighted values. You add all that up and you get your expected level of return. The expected return is K bar. Okay, So the expected return, you'll note for both of these cases, for both asset A and asset B is 15%. So we have the same expected level of return even though our range is different. So once we've calculated k bar, then we can compute the standard deviation. Okay. And the expression for calculating the standard deviation of returns is given on the slide here. Okay. So you can see that in order to calculate it, we need to take into account the K bar value or the expected value of returns. We also need to take into account the individual probabilities and individual estimates on rates of return. A very basic example on how to calculate standard deviation is provided on the screen here.

Okay. So this is continuing to build on the example that we had a few moments ago related to the expected value of the return. So you can see that we've got three situations, okay? These are labeled as one, two and three. Okay. For asset B and for asset A, So one is pessimistic, two is most likely three is optimistic. We've got returns of 13, 15 and 17 for asset A and 715 and 23% for asset B Okay. So that's the k J value that we see in this formula on standard deviation. And then we've got K bar K, remember K bar, we calculated on this slide here to be 15% for both asset A and for asset B, Okay. So the K bar value is therefore 15%. Now the difference between those K bar values and the individual probabilities is the first thing we have to calculate in calculating our standard deviation. Okay, so we take the k j value and subtract from that the K bar value. So 13 -15% is minus two for the case of case one and asset A 15 -15 is zero and 17 -15 is 2% for asset A for asset B, exact same calculation. Just as an illustration for case one, 7% -15% would be -8%. Then what you do is you basically take that number and you square it. Okay? So for instance, in the next column, we've got minus two squared. Okay, that gives us 4%.

Zero squared is 0%, two squared, 2% is 4% and likewise for asset B, okay, we get the square of 8% is 64%. Then you take that number and you multiply it by the probability of that particular situation occurring. So for the pessimistic, we had 25%, most likely we had 50% and optimistic we had 25%. Okay. So you have to take that probability and multiply it by this squared value to get another value. Okay. Then you basically add all that up and you take the square root and that's the standard deviation. Okay? So all we're doing here is applying this formula, All right? It makes use of the probabilities, makes use of the K bar value, makes use of those individual rates of return. Okay, so square root. Here's q r t is the standard deviation. Generally speaking, the higher the standard deviation, the higher the risk. Okay. Therefore, asset B would be said to be more risky than asset A Okay. So once again, higher standard deviations are associated with higher risk. That's something that we can see using the market history as well. Okay. So building on the table that we looked at earlier, Okay, recall we looked at some historical returns over a very, very long period of time between 1926 and 2003. Now we can look at the relationship between risk as expressed by standard deviation and annual rate of return. Okay. So again, we've got large companies, small company stocks, we've got corporate and government bonds, we've got Treasury bills and we've got inflation.

Okay. And once again, the real big thing here to highlight is the relationship between return and standard deviation, which you'll note reflects the principle of risk aversion. Okay? You'll see that higher returns are required for increases in risk. Okay. So the standard deviation is highest for small company stocks at 33.3%. They also tend to have the highest average annual return. Remember, we're talking about averages here, not individual companies. Okay. Individual companies can certainly fluctuate up and down. But generally the for cases where the standard deviation is highest, in other words, the risk is the highest, we would have the highest return. And again, that reflects the principle of risk aversion where we need to have higher returns for higher risk. The last thing that I wanted to talk about in this introductory lecture on risk and return is the coefficient of variation, and the coefficient of variation is very useful for comparing the risks of assets with differing expected returns. Okay. Standard deviation is used to compare the same returns. Okay. Coefficient of variation is used to compare risks of assets with differing expected returns. Okay. That's a very important point. So that's summarized in the first point here. You can see CV, which is how we abbreviate coefficient of variation is a measure of the relative dispersion and it's particularly useful in comparing the risks of assets with differing expected returns.

It's expressed as a ratio of the standard deviation and the expected value. A larger coefficient of variation implies a more volatile alternative and therefore a higher or larger coefficient of variation equates to more risk. Okay, so stated. Another way lower coefficient of variations are associated with lower risk. Okay. And once again, it's basically the ratio between the standard deviation and the expected value. So the standard deviation divided by k bar, very basic example on the coefficient of variation is displayed here on the screen. If a firm wants to select the less risky of the two assets listed in the table below, which one should it choose? Okay, so we've got asset A, we've got asset B, we've got expected returns of 12 and 20%. Note that these expected returns are different. Okay. If the expected return was the same, then we could compare it on the basis of standard deviation. But when the expected return. Is different. We have to use the coefficient of variation. So we've got the expected return. We've got the standard deviation of nine and 10% for asset A and asset B respectively. And then we calculate the coefficient of variation, which is again the standard deviation divided by the expected return, which is simply making use of the formula in the box here. So standard deviation divided by expected return gives us the coefficient of variation for asset A at 0.75 and for asset B it's 0.5. Now, judging solely on the basis of standard deviations, of course the firm would prefer asset A because it has a lower standard deviation.

Remember, lower standard deviations are associated with lower risk. And in this problem we're looking to choose the less risky of the two assets. However, this would be a serious error, okay, because when we have differing expected levels of return, we have to make the comparison of risk on the basis of the coefficient of variation. Okay. The coefficient of variation is what we use when we have differing expected returns. If the standard, if the expected return is the same once again, then you can use the standard deviation. If it's different, as is the case here, it's 12 and 20% respectively for assets A and B, you have to use the coefficient of variation. Okay, so the coefficient of variation is effective to compare risk in these scenarios because it also considers the relative size or the expected return of the assets. Okay. So in this case, because we have differing expected returns, we need to use the coefficient of variation because it takes that into account. Standard deviation does not. Of course, lower coefficient of variations are associated with lower risk and therefore the less risky asset here is asset B. So that brings us to the conclusion of our introduction to risk and return. Again, these are topics that are going to come up repeatedly throughout the rest of the course and we'll return to this in the next lecture. In fact, when we talk about the risk and return associated with portfolios.",6795,"[-0.00366312 -0.0226285   0.01828373 ... -0.02205514 -0.02446324

Introduction to Portfolio Risk,5.1,CEFA,"Title: Introduction to Portfolio Risk; Description: In this video lecture, the key takeaways revolve around the concepts of risk and return in portfolio management. The main point is that diversification of assets is crucial for spreading risks. Instead of investing in single assets, investors should choose portfolios as it diversifies away a portion of the risk. The lecture explains that the return of a portfolio is just the weighted average of the returns on the individual assets comprising it. Diversification is most effective when the returns on the assets move in different directions, as measured by correlation. Positive correlation limits diversification benefits, while negative correlation is desirable for risk spreading. The lecture also introduces the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which links risk and return for all assets. It highlights that total risk includes diversifiable risk, which can be eliminated through diversification, and non-diversifiable risk, known as systematic risk. The CAPM also presents benchmark investments, such as a risk-free return and a risk premium. Overall, the lecture stresses the importance of diversification in risk management and understanding the relationship between risk and return in portfolios. It also introduces the concepts of systematic and diversifiable risk, the role of beta in the CAPM, and the security market line (SML). The instructor acknowledges that the model assumes efficient markets and historical data, and future returns may not accurately reflect the calculated betas. The principles of risk and return will be further explored in future lectures, making them recurring themes in the course.; Transcript: Greetings and welcome back. In this lecture, we're going to continue our discussion of risk and return that we began in the previous lecture. Specifically, what we're going to do is we're going to talk a little bit about portfolio risk. We're going to explore the principles of diversification and correlation, and then we're going to finish by talking a little bit about the capital asset pricing model. As we're going through today's lecture, it may be useful to keep in mind that a diversified portfolio of assets spreads risk. This is really the key point of the lecture, and it's something that we're going to better understand. I think by the time we're done this particular this particular lecture. So in the previous lecture we looked at the risk of single assets in real world, real in real world situations, however, the risk of any single investment would not be viewed independently of other assets. If an investor holds a single asset, he or she would fully suffer from the consequences of poor performance. This is not the case for an investor who owns a diversified portfolio of assets. Okay, so when we're talking about an investment portfolio, basically what we're talking about is any collection or combination of financial assets. So more than one asset would constitute a portfolio. If we assume that all investors are rational and therefore risk averse, they will always choose to invest in portfolios rather than single assets. And the reason for this is that it will diversify away a portion of the risk that is inherent in putting all of your eggs in one basket.

Okay, So if you make an investment and you're only investing in one particular asset, then you live and die by that investment. Okay. So if things go really well, well, that's a good thing. Okay, you do well as well. But if things don't go so well, then that's not the best thing because you don't have anything to fall back on. Okay. So what diversification does is it allows you to get away from this risk again of putting all of your eggs in one basket. And again, that comes back to the key point that a diversified portfolio of assets helps to spread risks. The first thing that we need to understand then in the risk return relationship is just a very briefly review the principle of return and how it's calculated in terms of portfolios. The return of a portfolio is simply the weighted average of the returns on the individual assets from which it is formed. Okay. So if you're trying to figure out the return of any portfolio, all you have to do is take the individual returns associated with those assets, their relative percentage of that asset in the total investment portfolio. Multiply them and add it up and get the weighted average in order to compute the overall portfolio return. Okay. So all it is, is the weighted average in order to demonstrate this principle, there is an example in your course package that that does go through the calculation of a portfolio return.

I'm not going to go through it in class because again, all it is, is essentially the weighted average. And I think that the example is fairly straightforward. But I do encourage you to review that just to make sure that you do understand this concept that a portfolio return is just the weighted average of the returns on the individual individual assets from which it is formed. So that's the very brief introduction to risk or return pardon me. As it pertains to portfolios. Now, we'll talk a little bit more about the risk of a portfolio. And the first thing that we need to understand once again is this principle of diversification. And as we implied earlier a few slides ago, diversification essentially spreads around the risk through multiple investments. Okay. The other point that we need to understand is that one of the benefits of a portfolio, therefore, is that it allows you to diversify your risk. Okay. So if we have a portfolio, it means that we have we have more assets and therefore we're spreading around that risk by investing in these multiple investments. Okay. So another thing that we need to understand is that diversification is enhanced depending upon the extent to which the returns on the assets move together. Okay. And that's something that is typically measured by a statistic known as correlation.

And that's shown in the figure below here. But basically what it highlights again, is that the success of the diversification effort is related to the similarity of the investment profiles in the portfolio. So for instance, if you have two investments that are what we call perfectly positively correlated, meaning that they move together. Exactly. Then you haven't really done a great job diversifying. An example of this would be to buy stock in two oil companies. Okay, you've invested in two companies that are essentially in the same business. Okay. So you haven't really done a great job of spreading around your risk? Yes, it's spread around because now you're in two companies instead of one. But at the same time, you're still in the same business. Okay. Generally speaking, that's the type of investment where you probably have a positive correlation between the investments, even though if in reality it's not perfectly positive as displayed here on the screen, perfectly negative correlations mean that things move in the exact opposite directions. Okay. So for instance, you may invest in a company that has sales particularly strong during the summer and then invest in a company that has sales particularly strong in the winter. Okay. That might be an example of perfectly negative correlated examples where you have returns, where returns in one particular asset goes up, returns in another. The other asset would go down and vice versa. Now, even if two assets are not perfectly negatively correlated, an asset can still realize diversification benefits by combining them in a portfolio as shown in the figure.

Okay. So we have a couple of examples here. We have asset F and asset G, and if we combine those returns, basically we get the return of the portfolio of assets F and G. Okay. So you can see that asset A the return, what's the return is it starts by going up and then it has a bit of a dip things maybe take a turn for the worse and go down. Asset G starts off down and then goes up. And all this movement, of course, is around the expected value K bar. You'll see that as you combine them. Okay. What happens is that you get less variability around K bar around the expected value. Okay. So note that the diversified portfolio portfolio therefore moves closer to the expected value, which means that we can have a little more confidence that our real return will be closer to our expected return. With that in mind, then, if two series move in the same direction, okay, they're said to be positively correlated. If two series move in the opposite direction, they are negatively correlated. And again, the degree of correlation is measured by what we call the correlation coefficient. Okay. In general, the lower the correlation between the assets, the greater the potential for diversification of risk. Okay. So that's a very important point.

The greater the lower the correlation between two assets, the greater the potential diversification of risks. Okay. So two assets that are positively correlated. You're not really diversifying the risk that well, okay, you want negative correlation if you're trying to diversify the risk, if you're trying to spread it around. And really, that's what the the screen here, the slide on the screen here highlights. The next thing that I wanted to talk a little bit about is the capital asset pricing model. And the capital asset pricing model really is the basic theory that links risk and return for all assets. And I think it's very useful as a conceptual framework, particularly as it relates to this notion of portfolios. Really, there's two key points that I want to talk about, about the capital asset pricing model. And certainly it's important to note that this is not a comprehensive survey of all the work being done on a capital asset pricing model. We're just taking a quick snapshot of it to to highlight the two key concepts that are most important for our purposes. One is that a firm's total risk consists of two parts Non-diversifiable risk and diversifiable risk. And we're going to talk about what those are in a few moments. And the second key concept that the capital asset pricing model highlights is that there are two benchmark investments. One is a risk free return, the other is a risk premium. And again, we're going to talk about that a little bit more on the following slides.

So we're going to start by discussing the the fact that the capital asset pricing model highlights that a firm's total risk consists of two parts. Okay. Once again, they are systematic and unsystematic risk, otherwise known as Diversifiable and Non-diversifiable risk respectively. Diversifiable risk basically represents the portion of an asset's risk that is associated with random causes that can be eliminated through diversification. Okay. So as you can see on the screen here, as we add more and more stocks, okay, unsystematic risk decreases. Okay, it goes down. Okay. Because as you add more and more stocks, again, we can eliminate those random causes associated with the individual stocks through the diversification. Systematic risk or non-diversifiable risk, however, is attributable to market factors that affects all firms and it cannot be eliminated through diversification. Okay, so systematic risk applies to all companies and cannot be eliminated through diversification. Diversifiable risk, on the other hand, can. Okay. And that's highlighted on the next screen here. Some portfolio risk can be eliminated simply by holding a lot of stocks or in the case of a company, making a lot of different investments. Okay, that's what we call the diversifiable risk. However, some risk cannot be eliminated simply by adding more stocks or more investments because the variability is caused by events that affect the entire market. And some examples of that would include changes in macroeconomic factors like interest rates, inflation and the business cycle.

Those types of things affect all businesses, right? No, business is immune to inflation. All businesses are affected by that. And that is an example, therefore, of something that you can't eliminate through diversification. The second key point highlighted by the capital asset pricing model is the notion that there are two benchmark investments. Okay? One again is a risk free rate of return. The other is a risk free is a risk premium. Okay. And what capital asset pricing model does is basically apply this basic idea to develop an expected return for a stock or a firm based on what is called a beta. Okay. And beta is basically a relative risk factor compared to the market and a risk premium. Okay. So in order to take this risk free rate of return and risk premium into account, we have to look at this beta which is explained over the next few slides. To give you a bit of background on beta, Basically it comes from theories developed in the early 1960s where we had some researchers that developed an asset pricing model that measured only the amount of non. Diversifiable risk that a particular asset has again non-diversifiable risk is systematic risk. And through this research, the the people conducting this study basically observed that not all stock movement is linear and that not all stocks are perfectly correlated to the market. So in other words, the fact that the overall market goes up or down doesn't necessarily mean that individual stocks do.

The idea is that different stocks have different levels of responsiveness to the overall market, and essentially that's the key point of beta. Okay. And what the researchers reasoned is that if they could measure this variability, which they're calling essentially the systematic risk, then they could develop a model to price assets using only this risk. Okay? And once again, it assumes that unsystematic risk is irrelevant because it can easily be eliminated by diversifying. So typically in these types of analyses, we don't look at unsystematic risk or diversifiable risk because you can get rid of those that you can handle that you can manage that very easily by by simply diversifying. So the capital asset pricing model here tends to focus on systematic risk. Betas explored a little bit more on this screen, a bit more explanations of of where it came from. Again, the key point here is that beta is a measure of non-diversifiable risk. Okay? So in order to do in order to calculate beta, basically what's done is that you take the returns for the market or for the entire market and you plot the returns of the individual investment versus that. And what you get then is basically a measure of the responsiveness of the individual company to the changes in the overall market. Okay. So again, beta measures the asset's systematic risk and a couple of examples here.

In general, for example, cyclical companies like auto companies have high betas. They tend to be much more responsive to changes in the market. So if, for instance, the overall market is on the upswing, people are making lots of money, they tend to buy more cars and car companies tend to do better in those types of situations. On the other hand, when we have downturns, people don't tend to buy cars. Okay, so typically auto companies or other cyclical companies would therefore have higher betas, public utilities, okay. Which tend to have relatively stable levels of cash flow. Doesn't matter if things are going particularly well or particularly poorly in general, of course, they would be have some minor changes, but people do need to have heat in the winter, for instance, even if things aren't going particularly well, they tend to have lower betas, okay, because their cash flow once again is relatively stable and therefore they are therefore less responsive to changes in market conditions, which mean they have a relatively low market risk and therefore have a low beta. To give you a quick idea of how betas are derived prepared, this this slide here that shows a basic graph, the key idea is that the steeper the slope, the riskier the asset and higher beta indicates that a company is more responsive to changing market returns. Therefore, companies with higher betas are therefore more risky. Okay, so in this case, we have two assets with the individual asset return plotted versus the overall market return.

Okay. And again, those are the two key things that you need to do in order to calculate beta assets would therefore be more risky than asset R because it's steeper. Okay, it has a steeper slope and therefore it's more responsive to changing market returns and therefore is more risky. Okay. Now I'm not going to ask you on any of the tests to do any graphs associated with beta or anything like that. But you should understand the principle of beta and just have a quick idea or at least an idea of where where this concept comes from. In order to calculate beta of a portfolio. Once again, it's simply the weighted average. Okay, so if you're trying to figure out which of two portfolios are riskier, which you can do is you can take the beta of any individual asset and betas are widely available. Okay? You can get those on any financial website relatively easy to find the beta for any individual company. You take the beta for that company, which again is a relative measure of its risk. Considering the overall market return, you multiply that beta by the proportion that that asset constitutes of your overall portfolio. You add all that stuff up and then you can get the overall riskiness or the overall beta associated for your portfolio. Once again, higher betas are associated with higher risk. So in this particular case, you would see that portfolio B has a higher beta than portfolio for portfolio W and is therefore riskier.

Now beta, one of the ways that it shows up in calculations in this course at least, is through what we call the capital asset pricing model equation or the Capm equation. After estimating beta, which once again gives you a specific gives you a measure of a specific asset or portfolio, systematic risk, you can then take estimates of other variables in the model to obtain or calculate an asset or portfolio's required return. And that's done using the equation highlighted on the screen here. Okay. So the equation basically consists of the risk free rate of return plus the beta value that's represented by B, and then you multiply that by the expected return on the market portfolio once again, minus the risk free rate of return. And that will give you an idea of the asset's expected or required return. So in order to calculate the asset's expected or required return, we need to make use of this notion of the risk free rate of return. And we also need to make use of the market return as well as the beta. So that equation helps highlight that the required return for all assets is composed of two parts. There's the risk free rate of return and what we call essentially a risk premium. The risk premium is a function of both the market conditions and the asset itself.

And the risk free rate of return is usually estimated from the return on United States Treasury bills. Okay. We talked about US Treasury bills a little bit in the previous lecture and the fact that their rate of their rate of return is a little bit higher than inflation, but not particularly higher because they tend to have very little risk associated with them. There's virtually no risk that the United States government is not going to pay any obligations associated with Treasury bills. Because of that, they tend to be taken as the risk free rate of return. The risk premium then is composed of two parts. One is the market risk premium, the other is beta. Market risk. Premium is basically the return required for investing in any risky asset rather than the risk free rate. And beta again, is that risk coefficient, which measures the sensitivity of the particular stock's return to changes in market conditions. In order to get an idea of risk premium associated with individual stocks and bonds. We have this table here to just give us an illustration of that. Again, this table builds on some of the things we talked about in the previous lecture when we introduced the notions of risk and return. Once again, you can see that the the risks or the returns pardon me, associated with large company and small company stocks, corporate and government bonds and US Treasury bills are displayed here. And then the risk premium is essentially calculated by taking that rate of return and subtracting the risk free investment, which once again has taken to be United States Treasury bills.

You can therefore see that risk premiums are highest once again with small company stocks and lowest, of course, with the Treasury bill, which is assumed to have no risk in the capital asset pricing model. Just as an example of how to put this formula together and how it can be used to make a calculation. I prepared the example here towards the end of the slides. In this lecture you can calculate the required return for a company, assuming it has a beta of 1.25. You have the US Treasury bills rate of return of 5%. We have expected return for the market of 15%. Simply plug into the formula exactly as as illustrated in an earlier slide. And in this case you can calculate therefore that the expected level of return would be 17.5%. And you can also display this stuff graphically. Okay. And that's shown on the next slide here, where we basically you can see we have the assets risk premium plotted. We have its risk free rate of return plotted and we have the the market risk premium plotted as well. The line there, the SML, that's the security market line. Sml once again stands for security market line. And basically the position and slope of the SML are affected by two major forces inflationary expectations and risk aversion.

The steeper the slope in general, the greater the degree of risk aversion, because a higher level of return would be required for each level of risk as measured by beta. In other words, the risk premiums tend to increase, therefore increasing risk avoidance. A couple of general comments on Capm. Once again, there is an example in the course package on the capital asset pricing model just basically gives you some practice working with that basic formula. I'm not going to go over it. I think it's fairly straightforward, simply some plug and chug type calculations. Couple general comments. Capital asset pricing model assumes that markets are efficient, so it is a bit of an idealized model. It does rely on historical data, which means the betas may or may not actually reflect the future variability of the returns. I think this is a big, big one you really need to take. And keep in mind with the capital asset pricing model, betas are calculated based on historical values. And as we've discussed earlier in the course, the fact that a certain value was obtained in the past doesn't necessarily mean that that's going to be the same value in the future. And we also have this this cautionary point. Basically, the required return specified in the model should be used as rough approximate. Nations only now, as we were going through the capital asset pricing model and the discussion of of diversification and portfolios in today's lecture, we took a bit more of a top level approach and we talked a little bit about a stocks more than we have earlier on in the course.

We're going to talk about stocks considerably more in a future lecture. But basically I wanted you to retain a couple of key points that apply at the company level as well as as well as at this very top level where we're looking at markets and betas and such. The principle of diversification is something that all companies generally do. Okay, although companies may not invest in different types of businesses. For example, if you're a grocery company, you may not purchase an auto company. They tend to have different lines and different projects within their own business. Okay, so if you're a grocery company, you tend to sell all kinds of different products rather than just bananas, for instance. So there is diversification that does take place within companies, even though they may not be investing in completely different business lines. And of course the principle of diversifiable risk and non diversifiable risk is one that I'd like you to retain for the purposes of company focused investments, and we'll return to those points occasionally throughout the rest of the course. So that's all I wanted to say today in our discussion of portfolios. Once again, we are going to return to the concepts of risk and return many times throughout the rest of the course and you will see some of these principles reappear.",4945,"[-0.01834234 -0.01286645  0.01035826 ... -0.0211122  -0.0158533

Incremental Investment Analysis,6.2,CEFA,"Title: Incremental Investment Analysis; Description: The key takeaway from this video is that incremental investment analysis is a valuable tool in cost estimation and financial analysis. It helps resolve conflicting rankings between the NPV and IRR techniques and is commonly used in situations where there are multiple investment alternatives. The video highlights the importance of eliminating inferior projects that require higher initial investments and generate smaller cash receipts. It emphasizes the use of minimum acceptable rates of return as screening criteria. The decision rule for incremental NPV analysis is to select the higher cost alternative if the NPV of the incremental difference is greater than zero, and the cheaper option if it is less than zero. The video provides an example of an incremental NPV analysis and demonstrates how the differences between cash flows are used to calculate the incremental NPV. The instructor also mentions that incremental analysis can be done numerically for better sensitivity analysis. Overall, incremental investment analysis helps in making decisions between multiple investment alternatives by comparing the differences in cost and cash flows.; Transcript: Well, hello again. In this lecture, we're going to look at incremental investment analysis. And this is an important topic because it helps us to understand how we can resolve conflicting rankings between the NPV and internal rate of return techniques that we looked at in the previous lecture. What we're going to do is we're going to start off by providing a very brief introduction to incremental investment analysis. Then we'll talk a little bit about how an incremental internal rate of return analysis is actually done. We're very briefly also going to cover an incremental NPV analysis. But as you'll see, once we get into this lecture, those are actually very rarely done in practice. And in fact, the focus will be on incremental internal rate of return analysis. And then we'll close by discussing very briefly some cautions in investment analysis overall. Now, incremental investment analysis is a bit tricky conceptually, but basically it's useful for helping us to understand how do we choose between multiple investment opportunities, when should we choose a more costly alternative? And it's also very useful for understanding mutually exclusive projects and helping us to resolve conflicting rankings. It is an extra step, but if you prefer the internal rate of return method to the NPV analysis, it is one that you have to take. If you actually do wind up with conflicting rankings or you do have projects that have different cost structures. So incremental analysis is used when there is more than one investment alternative.

For example, we could have two processing technologies or two machine models or two machine tools or whatever. There's all kinds of different examples that are possible. Of course, an incremental cost is the difference between the cost of the two alternatives and only the differences between the alternatives are relevant. So once again, we're focusing on incremental analysis. We're focusing only on looking at the differences. And you'll see once we get into the analysis that looking at those differences is actually the underlying basis for the incremental internal rate of return analysis that we'll consider. It is important to note that when we are getting into these analyses that the do nothing alternative does exist. Okay. So the fact that you have two alternatives or three alternatives or ten alternatives, whatever it may be, always keep in mind that there's also always the option to do nothing. Okay? Generally speaking, there may be situations where you are required to do something if, for example, you're required to make a certain investment. But there are also situations where you may have a lot of examples, but you don't necessarily have to do anything. Okay? So please do keep in mind that the do nothing alternative does exist, and if none of the options satisfy the minimum criteria, then you don't necessarily have to do anything. Now that may seem like an obvious point, but it is one that I did. Just very briefly want to note.

As I mentioned earlier, internal rate of return method is by far more frequently used When we look at incremental investment analysis. Npv can also be used in practice. It's very rarely used and you'll see why in a couple of slides. That being said, incremental analysis may be examined either graphically or numerically. We are going to focus on the numerical method and it may be a bit more work, but I think that it does often provide a better sensitivity analysis. And the very first point to keep in mind when we're looking at incremental analysis is inferior projects should be immediately eliminated. That's demonstrated here in this on this particular slide, let's say that we have two well, we have two examples in this case. In the first case, we have two projects. Okay? We have Project A and we have Project B and we can see that Project A has a cash outflow of $10,000 in year one and cash inflows of $6,000 in years one through three. Project B has a cash outflow of 12,000in year zero and cash inflows of $5,000 from years one through three respectively. And you can see the difference between them that B minus A, that's the incremental difference. Okay. So B minus a 12,000, -10,000. 2000. 5000 -6000 is -1000 Et-cetera. That's what the incremental analysis is. However, we don't even have to do an incremental analysis in this case because we have a very clear case of an inferior project.

Okay. Option B can be rejected outright even without computing the NPV or the internal rate of return because it requires a higher initial investment and generates smaller cash receipts. Okay. So that's what we mean when we say an inferior project. Project B is one case. It has it requires a bigger investment and generates less cash than the other option. So clearly it's an inferior option. The other example that we have here in on the bottom of the screen is if our minimum acceptable rate of return is 12% and then we have four projects A, B, C and D, you can see that A, B, C and D all have a minimum, A pardon me? They all have an internal rate of return higher than that minimum acceptable rate of return. Project C doesn't. Okay, so Project C's internal rate of return is below the hurdle rate and for that reason it can be rejected outright. Okay. Obviously we use minimum acceptable rates of return as a screening criteria. If a project doesn't meet that, then you can eliminate it from further consideration. So that's the very first thing we need to do. We need to eliminate those inferior options. Then what we do is we can compare the remaining alternatives on the basis of an incremental NPV or internal rate of return analysis. Now for completeness, completeness sake, I'm just going to very briefly.

Talk about incremental NPV analysis. In practice, it's not something that's actually done. It's not something you actually have to do. And then we'll get into the incremental internal rate of return analysis. One of the key points in either case that we're going to look at throughout the remainder of the lecture is that each increment of investment capital must justify itself. Okay? That really forms the entire basis for the incremental analysis that we do. That being said, the next assumption that we make is that for two mutually exclusive projects and remember, incremental analysis is for mutually exclusive projects. In this case, A and B, we have B is the more expensive option. Basically, B has two cash flow components. One is the same as A and then the other is that incremental component, that B minus a component, that additional amount over and above the cash flow associated with A. Okay. That B minus a component. That difference between the two mutually exclusive projects is what we focus on. So the decision rule for incremental NPV analysis, the NPV of B minus A of that increment at Mar, if it's above zero, we would select Project B, If it's equal to zero, we could go either way. And if the NPV of the increment itself, of the difference between the examples is less than zero, then we would select a. So once again, what this incremental analysis does, one of its advantages is that it helps in one of its uses is that it helps us to decide when we should choose a higher cost alternative.

So if the if the NPV of the increment in this case is greater than zero, we would select the higher cost alternative. And again, remember, B is the more expensive option under these assumptions. If it's less, then we would go with with a okay. If the Ma is less than zero, we would go with a which is the cheaper option. At the bottom of the screen you can see that the NPV of the increment of B minus A is equal to the NPV of B minus the NPV of A individually. Okay. Therefore, we can compare these directly. And that's something that's not true for the internal rate of return. And we're going to come back to that point when we we get back to this later. But basically that last point is expressed, I think, best through an example. Okay. So if we take a look at an incremental NPV analysis example, you see we have two two companies. Okay? We've got A and B, we have a cash outflow of 3012 thousand respectively. At time zero. We have cash inflows of 5500 for years, one through three for Project A and 4000 506,006 thousand for years one, two and three. In Project B now, again, when we're looking at incremental analysis, we need to look at the difference between these two options.

Okay. In this case, we don't have a clearly inferior option, so we can't immediately reject one of these. We need to consider both of them. So what we do then, the next step is to take a look at the differences between them. So A, B minus A, okay. We see it's -9000 and time zero 3000, which is just 4500 -1000 506,000 -1500 for years, two and three for an increment of 4500. Therefore, our incremental cash flows are -9000 in year zero, 3000 in year one and 4500 in years two and three. You can then calculate the NPV of that increment. Okay, So you'll see that the NPV at 10%. So let's say we're trying to compute the NPV at a Ma of 10%. You can see the NPV of A comes to 730 and the NPV of B comes to 1557. Now the NPV of the increment comes to 827. You'll note that the NPV of the increment is actually equal to the NPV of B minus A directly. Okay. So you can actually compute the difference between these directly. That is not something that you can do in the internal rate of return method. Okay. So because we can compare the NPV of A and the NPV of B directly, we therefore don't normally have to do the NPV analysis for incremental purposes. Okay. You can compare them directly. So it's really an extra step that doesn't add any value to go to the point of calculating the NPV of the increment because you can figure out the NPV of that increment simply by taking the difference between the NPV of the individual mutually exclusive projects.

Okay? That is not something that's true for internal rate of return. Okay? And that's really the main reason why we're looking at this. And keep in mind, in addition to helping us figure out whether or not we should invest in a more costly alternative, the other advantage in using the incremental internal rate of return analysis is that it helps us to resolve conflicts based on the NPV and internal rate of return methods that we talked about in the previous lecture. If we have a conflicting ranking, we can actually go and do this extra step and figure out computationally the difference between them. Okay. So to do so, we create and analyze an incremental project reflecting the differences in cash flows between the two mutually exclusive projects. Again, each increment of investment capital must justify itself. And again, our analysis from an incremental internal rate of return perspective is based on this notion of having B is a more expensive option to project. A consists of two cash flow components. We have a and then we have the amount over and above that. And our focus again is on the incremental portion on that B minus a portion. If the incremental rate of return of that particular increment, if the internal rate of return part of me of that particular increment is above Ma, we would select the.

Higher cost option, we would select B If it's equal to Ma, you can go either way. And if it's less than ma, you would select the lower cost option. And we're going to see what that means in some examples in a few moments. Note that last bullet point that the internal rate of return of the increment is not equal to the difference between the internal rate of return of the projects individually. That's a very important point, and that's why we cannot compare the internal rates of return for individual options directly. Okay. For NPV, we could for internal rate of return. We can't we actually have to go to the trouble of figuring out the internal rate of return of the incremental cash flow. And that's something that you can see on this screen here. Okay. So question we may have is assuming we have the extra money, is the extra investment worth it? Consider that we have two projects and we have a minimum acceptable rate of return of 10%. Okay. So we have the same cash flows for A and B as we did in our NPV example. Our internal rate of return for A is 23%. That's really good. That's well above our Ma of 10%. Our internal rate of return of B is 17% and that's really good as well.

That's also above Ma. So both of these are acceptable. Now, if we were just going on the internal rate of return method itself and we didn't bother looking at the incremental method, we'd probably go with Project A, right, because the internal rate of return is higher. But the key question is, is that extra investment worth it? Okay, remember, Project B is worth a lot more costs, a lot more money, but it also results in a lot greater cash flow. To figure that out, we look at the incremental difference between these mutually exclusive options. Okay, so we take our B minus A, that's -12,000. -3000 is -9000. 3000 and 4500 for years, one, two and three respectively. Our incremental cash flows. And then we figure out the internal rate of return of that incremental cash flow. Okay. Note that the incremental the internal rate of return or the incremental cash flow in this case is 15%. And note that that is not equal to 23%, -17%. Okay. When we looked at NPV, you could compare the individual NPV, subtract them, and you'd get the exact same answer as your incremental NPV. That is not the case for internal rate of return. Okay. You've got to go through it and actually compute the internal rate of return on that individual increment. Okay. So in this case, then in the case of this example, okay, both A and B are individually acceptable because their respective internal rates of return are above Ma.

Since the internal rate of return on the incremental cash flow is also above Ma, however, that 15% is higher than 10%. The additional investment in Project B is justified. Okay. And that goes back to our criteria on the previous screen. Okay. Note here that if the incremental, the internal rate of return on that incremental cash flow, B minus A is higher than Ma, greater than Ma, we would select the higher cost alternative. Okay? So if we're looking to maximize the internal rate of return, maybe we would choose project A right. If we're just, you know, we don't have or we don't have the cash available. Pardon me is the main reason. If, however, we're looking to maximize our overall investment. Okay. We would choose Project B, The rationale for this is spelled out a little bit more. On the next slide. We're going to jump over to some examples in Excel right away. But just to to help clarify here regarding the projects, A and B, okay, imagine that we have $12,000 in a bank and it's earning 10% interest. Okay? That's why our minimum acceptable rate of return is 10%. We wouldn't invest in anything else, less than 10%. If you withdraw $3,000 in invested in Project A, okay. We find that at 23, at 23%, the remaining $9,000 only continues to earn 10%. Okay. So we've out of the $12,000 that we had in the bank, we invested 3000 in Project A okay.

And that earned 23%. That's great. But the remaining 9000 only earned 10%. If, however, we invested that incremental $9,000 in Project B, the increment would earn 15%. Okay, that's above Ma. Okay. So therefore, if we have the money available, okay, we can invest in Project B to maximize our overall investment. As I said, there's a couple of examples that I prepared in Excel here. There's also an example in your course package that I'm going to go over in a few minutes. But first I did want to go over the examples in Excel because it just gives you a few more illustrations of how you can put this stuff together and how you can put this stuff to work. In this case. Okay, we're given the option of investing in two mutually exclusive projects. Is the additional investment in Option B justified if the Ma is 14%? So we've got cash flows for Project A given these future cash flows, I've already calculated the present value for you. Once again, if you click on that any of these cells, you can see the formula. Okay, so present value is just equal to the future value divided by one plus I to the n, okay one plus the interest rate to the year. So we've got Project A has certain cash flows. Project B, okay, Project B's cash flows note are higher. Okay. We have a higher cash expenditure to get this project going and then we have some higher cash inflows as well as we would expect.

Otherwise it would be an inferior project. So higher cash outflow, but yeah, higher cash inflows as well. Then we have to look at the difference between them. So the increment. That's what these columns are. So you take column B's future value minus column A's future value or Project A's. Pardon me? Project B and Project A's. So 300 -200. It's 100. That's where we get these values. For instance, in year five, the cash inflow is 300. The cash for Project B, the cash inflow is 225 for Project A. There's therefore a difference or an incremental cash flow as $75. You then calculate the present value of that incremental cash flow. Right. So you you take that and then you plug in the formula present value or future value equals or present value, pardon me equals future value divided by one plus I to the n add all that all all that up and you can get your NPV. In this case, I've used Goalseek to figure out the internal rate of return earned by these cash flows. You can also figure out the internal rate of return or the interest rate on those cash flows using the internal rate of return formula directly. Right. You could have simply used the equals IRR function in Excel as we did in previous examples. You'll note that in this case the interest or essentially the rate of return earned by the incremental cash flow is less than 14%.

Okay. So the amount the interest earned by this incremental cash flow is less than 14%, which is our minimum acceptable rate of return. And if that's the case, if the rate of return that we earn is less than Ma, then we reject the project. Okay. And that again goes back to our decision criteria back on the slide here, right? If that increment earns more than Ma, we would select the higher cost alternative. If it earns less than Ma, however, we would choose the lower cost alternative because that increment essentially is not justifying itself. There's another example in Excel. Okay, so just so you can see how you can put this stuff together. In this case, you're given the option of investing in two mutually exclusive projects. Is the additional investment in option B justified if the Ma is 12%? Okay. So in this case, we've got a different Ma than we had in the previous case. This time you look at the incremental cash flows, once again, you take the differences between B and A, calculate the internal rate of return of that particular cash flow and you'll find that it comes to 18.1% in this case. Okay. Again, I solved it using goal seek here. Okay. Just as I've done in previous examples in previous in previous lectures, you can also solve it directly using the internal rate of return method.

The key point, however, is that incremental cash flow is above Ma and therefore the additional investment is justified once again assuming that you have the capital available. Now, the key steps in incremental analysis are summarized here on the screen. Basically, the first thing that we have to do is identify all acceptable alternatives that fulfill similar system outcomes. Okay. We arrange the alternatives in ascending order of investment. So once we've gotten rid of the inferior option, we arrange them in ascending order of investment so that we can compare the more expensive to the less expensive option. Now, all the examples that we did previously, all the examples up to this point in the lecture were for two cases, you can actually do it. For many cases it could be as many as you want. The key is that you have to organize the alternatives in ascending order of investment so that you can compare by successive elimination or you can make pairwise comparisons of the higher cost or the lower cost alternative. You're going to see that in an example in a moment. So we we identify all the acceptable alternatives, basically eliminate those inferior options, arrange the alternatives in ascending order of investment. Okay. So anything that made it past that inferior screen compute the rate of return for each alternative. Discard the alternatives where the internal rate of return is less than Ma and then make a pairwise analysis of the alternatives by successive elimination, comparing them to each other until you figure out which is the best option.

Now we're going to look at an example right away in your course package on how you can use this for cases where you have more than two mutually exclusive options. But the key point here again, is that the incremental internal rate of return is the return on the additional spending, it's the return on that increment. And we also this is a very important point. We also choose the more costly alternative only if the incremental IRR is above Ma. Okay. And if capital is available, remember, you have to have the capital available. Okay? You would only you would only choose the higher cost alternative if you actually had the money available to make that. Okay. So the key question is, you know, what are we going to do with that extra cash? Okay. We can either leave it in the bank or we can invest it to create additional value. If the internal incremental internal rate of return is above Ma, Okay, then you would invest it in the higher cost alternative if you had that extra cash available. So as I was saying, so far we've looked only at two alternative options. But of course there are other situations to consider. Okay, so let's just bring that example up here. And this example, as I mentioned, is in your course package.

And basically it demonstrates that this approach is perfectly valid no matter how many projects you have. Okay. So you can do an incremental analysis for more than two projects. In this case, we have five projects. You can just as easily do this for 10 or 20. Of course it would be a little bit more effort, but the same principle applies. So the following information is provided for five mutually exclusive alternatives that have 20 year useful lives. The minimum acceptable rate of return is 6%. Which alternative should be selected? We've been given the cost for all five projects. Okay. This is basically the cash outflow. We've been given a uniform annual benefit. That's basically the cash inflow. Okay. So we're told what the cash inflow is. We're told what the cash outflow is. We're told what the NPV of the benefit is and we're given the internal rate of return. Okay. Now, of course, you could actually set up spreadsheets to accommodate more complex cash flows, if you like. It doesn't have to be a uniform annual cash flow. You could have all kinds of different ones and then you could compute the NPV and the internal rate of return, just as we've done in many examples before. Here are all the information is given for demonstrative purposes. So the first thing that we do is we eliminate inferior options. Okay? We can see that the internal rate of return for each alternative equals or exceeds Ma.

Okay, So remember our minimum acceptable rate of turn, our Ma is 6%. The internal rate of return for each of those options is above 6%. Therefore, none of these options are rejected. Okay, they're all acceptable. Then you move on to the next step. The next step is to arrange the alternatives to put them in order of increasing cost so that we can make a comparison of higher cost to lower cost alternatives. Okay, so what we've done here is we've taken all of these options, all these options that we have and we've arranged them in order of increasing cost. So D was cheapest thousand, B was next at 2000, A was next at 4000. C was the second most expensive option at 6000 and Project E was the most expensive at 9000. Okay. So we just put all that information in exactly as we had before. We also transfer in the uniform annual benefit and the internal rate of return. So all that information, it's just rearranged. It's all the same information just in a different order. Next, we make a pairwise comparison of the alternatives by successive elimination. So basically what you do is you look at the difference between these increments. Okay, so the first one we need to look at is B minus D, okay? You look at the two lowest cost alternatives and then you choose the the best one and then move on to compare it to the next one.

Okay. That's basically what this is. So B minus D, you take the cost differences. So 2000 -1000 is 1000. The difference between the annual benefit for ten -117 and then you can compute the internal rate of return on that. In this case, I've given it to you, But once again, you can figure out the internal rate of return on these cash flows over a 20 year useful. If you can plug that into Excel, if you like, just to verify that if you're so inclined. So we begin with the analysis of increment B versus D, and we find that it has an internal rate of return of 29%. That incremental cash flow of B minus D has an internal rate of return of 25%. Therefore, because this internal rate of return is above the minimum acceptable rate of return, we would accept the higher cost alternative. In this case, B is the higher cost alternative. We found that the internal rate of return of that increment is above Ma. So we would select B Okay. And because of that alternative D is discarded. We know that D is not as good as B, so B is what we need to consider. We need to consider when we're comparing it to other projects. The next thing that you do is you then compare B to A, So we've selected B out of this, two out of these two, and then we need to compare B to the next lowest cost alternative.

In this case, that's Project A, So the what you do is you do the increment of A minus B, In this case, the cost is 4000 -2000. The incremental cost annual benefit is 639 -410, that's 229. And the internal rate of return, you can compute to be 10%. Again, I've given that to you. Okay. Note that's not just a minus B in terms of internal rate of return, you have to figure out the internal rate of return on a cost of 2000 and an annual benefit of 229. In any case, the internal rate of return on A is above Ma on A minus B pardon me on that increment is above Ma. Therefore we would retain a okay. So A is the superior option. Once again, we would say, okay, it's worth it to invest in that higher cost alternative. Then we go on to the next project. Okay? Then we go on to Project C and then we look at the increment incremental cash flow, C minus A, okay, so 6000 -4000 gives us our cost. 761 -639 gives us our annual benefit internal rate of return we can calculate that comes out to be 2%. In this case, the rate of return on this increment is less than Ma. Okay. Remember, Ma is 6%. This is less. Okay. This is 2%. Our ma is 6%.

So for this reason, increment C is rejected and we would stay with increment A okay and do the exact same thing for E for project E, which is the most expensive alternative. And in this case you can see that clearly. Clearly Project E is a inferior option. It it's not going to provide benefits that exceed the cost. So we discard it and we find therefore that project A is the best of the five alternatives. Okay. So again, that's exactly the same type of process that we were looking at earlier on. Of course, earlier we were looking only at examples that had two projects for two mutually exclusive projects. But it is important to note that you can apply this for as many projects is necessary to figure out whether that extra cost is worth it essentially is the point of the incremental internal rate of return analysis. Now, when we're looking at project analysis in general, then it's important that we do use a consistent, thorough methodology. Basically, we determine our alternatives. We identify all the possibilities. We identify the the time period under which we want to do an analysis. We estimate the cash flows for each of those alternatives. And again, we need to pay particular attention to making sure that those cash flows are as accurate as possible, because again, all subsequent analysis is going to be based on those cash flows. And we need to make sure that the time period we select is reasonable as well.

Okay. Otherwise our analysis isn't going to give us numbers that make sense. We then identify the Ma, the minimum acceptable rate of return and the measures of merit. Compare the results. We identify sensitivity and issues, do a whole bunch of sensitivity analysis, and then we select the best alternative. So that gives us a generic process that we basically been applying over the last few lectures when we've been looking at our capital budgeting techniques in general, it's important to note that there are some pitfalls in using investment analysis. Of course, discounted cash flow techniques are heavily weighted to earlier years, and this is of course based on the principle of compound interest and the fact that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. And that's something that we can very clearly see from our study of the time value of money, as I've mentioned a few times earlier on, implicitly. But to make it very explicit here, the math is more sophisticated than the forecast. It's the limiting factor here is not the calculations themselves. It's making sure that the numbers that the calculations are are analyzing are as accurate as possible. Okay. So keep in mind that the numbers, the forecast, the cash flow forecast themselves often evolve under political influence. They may be a judgment call from a senior person with an organization. And because of that, the limiting factor is not the sophistication of the analysis, but rather the quality of the assumptions that go into the cash flow forecast.

And with that in mind, therefore, the accuracy of the forecast is frequently orders of magnitude less than the accuracy of the analytical tools implied. Keep in mind that a deceptive confidence can ensue and therefore we need to spend a lot of time up front making sure that those cash flows are as accurate as possible, that we've selected a reasonable time period, that the interest rate we're using is reasonable as well. And keep in mind, of course, that calculations are not the only factors to consider. We've got to look at things like strategic fit, whether or not it's a senior person or owner's favorite project. Availability of capital and risk, of course, are big ones that also jump out at me were economic decisions are immediate. We need to consider taxes and operating expenditures and were there over a period of time. Of course we need to consider inflation, interest, competition, technology changes, obsolescence, market shifts, of course, risk in general. So that gives you some ideas of a number of the things that need to go into these analyses. So that's all I wanted to say about incremental internal rate of return analysis today. Keep in mind that this is a particularly useful technique for identifying whether the extra investment associated with a particular project is worth it. And for that reason, it is important that all engineers at least have some understanding of how to apply and use this technique in practice.",7039,"[-0.01039543 -0.01253567  0.01031737 ... -0.01647136 -0.01975003

Capital Budgeting Refinements,6.4,CEFA,"Title: Capital Budgeting Refinements; Description: In this video, the instructor discusses various refinements in the capital budgeting process. The key takeaways from the video include the importance of considering projects with unequal lives when comparing them. The instructor introduces the concept of annualized net present value (A NPV), which converts the NPV of unequal-lived projects into an equivalent annual amount. The process to calculate the A NPV is explained in detail, using Excel formulas and calculations. The video highlights that comparing projects based solely on NPV can lead to the wrong decision when projects have unequal lives. 
The video also discusses the concept of real options in capital budgeting and how they can impact a project's NPV and risk. Various types of real options, such as abandonment options and flexibility options, are mentioned. The instructor introduces the concept of strategic NPV, which is the sum of the traditional NPV and the value of real options.
Capital rationing, where limited funds are available for investment in projects, is also discussed in the video. The instructor explains that firms must choose among acceptable projects with positive NPVs based on the available budget. Two different approaches to guide capital rationing decisions are mentioned: the IRR method and the NPV method. The video highlights that the IRR approach may not guarantee the maximum dollar return to the firm, while the NPV approach aims to maximize the overall NPV by considering both the IRR and present value of benefits.
The video concludes by emphasizing the importance of considering risk-adjusted discount rates, real options, and capital rationing in investment decisions. It recommends reviewing an example in the course material that incorporates these principles. Overall, the video provides a comprehensive guide for students to understand and apply refinements in capital budgeting, specifically when comparing projects with unequal lives, recognizing real options, and dealing with capital rationing.; Transcript: Greetings Over the last several lectures we've been talking about capital budgeting and what we're going to look at today and talk about is discussing some common refinements in the capital budgeting process. Specifically, what we're going to look at is, first of all, comparing projects with unequal lives. And we'll talk a little bit about recognizing real options. And then we'll finish up by talking about capital rationing. Keep in mind that refinements must often be made in the analysis of capital budgeting projects to accommodate special circumstances. And really these three points here, the three points on the screen are some of the areas that are most commonly needed from a refinement perspective. So we'll take a look at each of those very briefly over this lecture. Over the course of this lecture. Of course, this just generally reemphasizes the points made on the previous screen, the three areas where special attention is generally needed. And once again, there may be other areas, but these are the three ones that come up most frequently and are the ones that we're going to focus on in this lecture. We'll start by, first of all, going through the comparison of mutually exclusive projects, having unequal lives, and note that we are talking about mutually exclusive projects when we're discussing that particular area. Then we'll talk a little bit about the recognition of real options, which is an area that is undergoing a lot of research at the current time. And then we'll talk about capital rationing caused by a budget, a binding budget constraint.

We talked very briefly about capital rationing earlier on in the course. And here we'll look at it in a little bit more detail and see how you can accommodate and how you can adjust the circumstances when you are facing capital rationing restrictions. So the first thing that we're going to look at is comparing projects with unequal lives. And in this case, keep in mind that it's applying specifically to mutually exclusive projects. Okay? So A projects are independent. Comparing projects with unequal lives is not critical if they're independent. Basically we just look at them on the basis that we have been doing thus far NPV and internal rates of return being the primary decision criteria. However, when we have unequal projects that are mutually exclusive, the impact of those differing lives must be considered. Because keep in mind that those projects do not provide service over comparable time periods. Okay, this is particularly important and must be particularly emphasized when continuing service is needed from the projects under consideration. Of course, if the projects are not ongoing, then the project with the highest NPV would be selected. But if they are ongoing and we do require continuing service from those projects, then we really need to pay attention to making these comparisons as we're going to learn over the next few screens to get this discussion going. I think it's best to look at this from the perspective of an example.

Okay. So in this case, you can see that we've got two example companies or two two example projects, pardon me, within a company we've got Project X and we've got Project Y. The cost of capital for both of those projects is 10%. They have a different initial investment. So Project X is initial investment is $70,000, Project Y is is $85,000. And then you can see we have a number of cash flows associated with each projects. But the key point that we really want to emphasize here is that these projects have different lives. Okay? So you can see Project X has cash flows of 28, 33 and 38,000 over years, one through three, and then doesn't have any cash flow at all from years 5 to 6. This is basically a three year project. Project Y, however, is a six year project, so it has cash flows not only in years one, two and three, the same as Project X, but it also has cash flows in year four, five and six. Now we can calculate the NPV as we've done earlier on in the course, basically taking the future value of these cash flows and dividing it by one plus I to the n, of course, we have the interest rate of 10% that we're using here in the cost of capital. But comparing the projects solely on the basis of NPV in this case is insufficient because these projects have different lives. Okay. So to compare these unequal lived or mutually exclusive projects correctly, we have to consider the differing lives in the analysis.

Okay. And the reason for this is that an incorrect decision could result from simply using NPV to select the better project. And although there are a number of different approaches available for dealing with unequal lives in this class and in this lecture, what we're going to use is the most efficient technique, which is known as the annualized net present value. And we're going to get to that in a moment. But to reemphasize a couple of the points from that example, then ignoring the difference in their useful lives, both projects do have acceptable npvs They're both acceptable on the basis of NPV because the NPV is for both of those projects are acceptable. If the projects were independent, we'd probably go with Project Y because it has the higher MPV. Okay. Remember, if we're looking at independent projects, we make the selection on the basis of the higher NPV or internal rate of return. In this case, we're focusing on NPV. If the projects are mutually exclusive, however, we do need to consider those different lives. Okay. In this particular case, we have to recognize that the end of the three year Life Project X has to be replaced or renewed, because in this case, we're looking at an ongoing project. And once again, the most efficient technique for comparing these uneven project lives is something called the a NPV or the annualized net present.

Value approach. Basically, the A NPV approach converts the NPV of an unequal life, lived mutually exclusive projects into an equivalent, at least in NPV terms, annual amount that can be used to select the best project. There's three key steps, and they're summarized here on the screen, and we're going to see how to apply these in an example on the slides and then also in an example in the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. The three steps to compute the A NPV are, first of all, to calculate the NPV of each project over its life using the appropriate cost of capital. So the first step is to compute the NPV exactly as we've done before. Okay, you take the future value of those cash flows, you divide them by one plus I to the n, of course, I being the cost of capital in this case or the appropriate interest rate. You add all that up and then you can get your NPV. The second thing once you've done that is we have to make use of the PMT or the payments command in Excel. And what you do in this case is you use that NPV that we calculated in step one as the present value. Okay? So once we get into the Excel spreadsheet, you'll see that the payment command basically requires that you specify an interest rate, the number of periods, and then the present value. And in this case, what you use for the present value is the NPV that we calculated in step one.

Then the last step that we do is we have to select the project with the highest NPV. So the highest NPV is the most desirable project, at least on this decision making criteria. So the first example that we're going to look at is the one here on the screen, and then we're going to look at an example in Excel as well. And even in this example, I did spell out very explicitly the formulas that are used to make these calculations so that you can see how you could put this together in an Excel spreadsheet. So in this case, we're looking at the same projects that we were looking at earlier on. So we have Project X and we have Project Y. Once again, the cost of capital is 10%. We have cash outflows at time zero to get the project started. Once again, recall that numbers in parentheses represent negative numbers and cash outflows are always a negative number. And then we have a bunch of cash inflows. And those cash inflows, of course, are over different periods of time for Project X and Y, which is why we need to use the A NPV. Okay. So the first step recalled from the previous slide is to calculate the NPV of each project over its life using the appropriate cost of capital. So once again, you calculate the NPV exactly as before. So we take basically what we do is we try to convert to a present value all those cash flows received over the life of the project, using, in this case, the cost of capital of 10% to discount those cash flows.

You can see that Project X is cash. Npv comes out to be just over 11,000. So $11,277. Project Y comes out to be just over $19,000 in this case, $19,000, $19,013. So that's the first step. Calculate the NPV. The next step is to use the payment command in Excel with the NPV as the present value. Okay. As the PV number that's required in the payment formula and the formula to actually calculate the NPV is displayed at the very bottom of the screen here. So what you have to do is use that PMT function and once again, I'll show you how to do that in Excel in a moment. But if you're looking for more information on the payment function within Excel, once again, you can access that information and you can access information on any of the functions in Excel through the methods that I've shown you earlier on in the course in this case. Okay. What you do is you essentially put PMT. Okay, then you have it in brackets. Okay, We have the interest rate that's being used in this case, that's 10% or 0.1. You have the number of years that cash flow occurs. In this case, for Project X, that's three years. Okay. You can see we have cash inflows for years one, two and three.

And for Project Y, we have cash inflows occurring over six years. Okay. So you can see that we have cash flows in years one, two, three, four, five and six. Okay. So you take, you use that as the number of periods value, the number of years that you receive cash flow. The next thing that you need to enter into the payment formula is essentially that NPV value that you calculated in the first step. Okay? So you can see that in this case for Project X, we've got the PMT formula, we've got a bracket with 0.1. That's the 10% interest rate. We've got a three for the number of years and then we've got the 11 to 77. That's the NPV. Okay. If you plug all that in, the NPV for Project X comes out to be $4,534.65. And if you plug that stuff in for Project Y, once again, using the NPV of $19,013, in addition to the cost of capital of 10% and the number of years of six, you find that the NPV comes to be $4,365.53. Note that in this case, then the NPV for Project X is actually higher than the NPV for Project Y. Okay. So if we compare these on the basis strictly of the NPV, we would have come up with the wrong answer. Okay. The reason we have to use the NPV in this case again is if we have mutually exclusive projects and they have different lives, you have to use the A NPV to get a sense of the actual annualized net present value being generated by this project, taking into account the fact that these projects need to be ongoing and that they have these differing.

Lives. So in this case, note that although Project Y would have been selected under the NPV method. Project X would be selected under the NPV method. And for that reason, using the NPV alone is insufficient for projects with unequal lives. Presuming that the projects once again are mutually exclusive. In addition to the example in your slides, there is an example in Excel, and I'm just going to go over to this for a moment. And of course the main reason of this example is to give you an example so you can actually see all the formulas applied in Excel and you can have an example of how to put together this type of calculation. In this case, we've been asked to calculate the NPV and the a NPV for the cash flows in the table, assuming that the interest rate is 12%. So you can see here that we've got cash flows for three projects. Okay. And again, these projects have differing lives. Okay. So Project A has a six year life project B has a four year life project, C has a five year life. Once again, we have cash outflows to get the project going at time zero. Those are different for A, B and C, A has 92,000, B 65,000 and C, $100,500 respectively.

And then each of these has differing cash inflows occurring over a differing number of years. Okay. So Project A has cash inflows occurring over six years of $12,000. Project B's cash flows occur only over four years of ten, 20, 30 and 40,000 respectively. And Project C has $30,000 cash inflows occurring over a five year period. So to calculate the net present value once again, what you have to do is basically make use of those compound interest formulas that we first introduced when we talked about the time value of money. So you take basically you have to compute the present value of each of those individual cash flows by taking that cash flow. So the future value divided by one plus e raised to the N. Once again, those formulas are available in the Excel spreadsheet that you've been provided in the course package, and I do encourage you to review those. You then sum up all those numbers. Okay, so you sum up all the cash inflows and outflows associated with a particular project and you get the NPV. Okay? So you sum up the present value equivalents of those cash inflows and outflows, and that gives you the NPV. You can see that under the NPV Method Project, C actually has the highest NPV. So if we go through all those calculations, Project A is NPV is negative. That means it does not earn the interest rate specified. Project B's is a is a positive number over $6,600.

And Project C is in this case, has an NPV of over $7,600 for the highest number. However, if you want to compare these on the basis of a NPV, which once again you must do for mutually exclusive projects having differing lives, you'll see that the A NPV method actually gives us a different answer of what's preferred in this case, under the basis of the A NPV method, we would choose Project B, okay, or machine B in this case rather than C, Okay. So under the NPV method, yes, C is the best, but under the A NPV method we would go with Project B once again in order to compute the A NPV, you have to use the formula specified and specified on the slides. A few moments ago. And again, if you're looking for information on those formulas and how to apply them, you can find that in the Excel spreadsheet. So you click on the cell that has a NPV calculated, let's say for Project A, you go up to the entry bar and you'll see that there's an equals PMT sum brackets. Then there's more information given on each of those components. Okay. So the first thing specified is the interest rate. That's 12%. The next thing specified is the number of periods which recall is basically the life of the project, the number of years that cash inflow occurs. And then you have that PV command. But remember, the number that you have to put in for the PV is the NPV that you calculated above.

Okay. So that's basically just using the formula displayed here on the slides. Okay. So the example in Excel just uses this approach and it just gives you an illustration of how to do this in the Excel spreadsheet. So you can see how these numbers are actually put together. The second refinement that I wanted to consider in this lecture is this notion of real options and how companies may recognize real options in their capital budgeting processes. Real options essentially are options that are embedded in capital projects that enable managers to alter their cash flows and risk in a way that affects project acceptability. Once again, the recognition of real options is an active area of research. It increasingly does appear in engineering, economics and finance textbooks. So any textbook that you look at may or may not have some information depending on real options, depending on the author. But this is something that's becoming more frequently used. Sometimes they're referred to as strategic options. So real options and strategic options are often used synonymously. And once again, that's just another illustration of the imprecision of some of the terms that we use in this course. The fact is that many terms or many different analysts will use different terms to represent the same thing. So sometimes it's called real options, sometimes it's also called strategic options. In any case, some of the common types of real options that may occur in any particular project are summarized here on the screen.

One is the abandonment option. Okay, so you may have an option to actually terminate a project prior to the end of the plan life, and that could have a very real impact on a project's NPV. And what this real Options method does is it allows us to take into account an option like the abandonment option. It also allows us to take into account options such as the flexibility option, which basically means that potentially we could design a system or a project to accommodate multiple scenarios. It could take into account a growth option, basically meaning that we may be accounting for growth options in the initial system and timing. Okay. It may take into account the fact that we could start, delay or accelerate a project. And all of these are are simply illustrations of the different types of opportunities or options that may present themselves whenever you undertake any other project, any particular project now. Explicit recognition of these real options may alter the cash flow and the risk of a project. And if you do explicitly recognize these real options, you may find that this could cause the project strategic NPV to differ from its traditional NPV. Okay. So in order to take into account real options, basically what we do is we introduce this notion of a strategic NPV and we say that the strategic NPV is the sum of the NPV as we would normally calculate it, plus the value of the real options.

Okay. Now, to give you an example of how to apply real options in practice, we are going to look at an integrative example towards the end of the lecture. Okay. So we are going to come back to this and show you how to actually compute real options in practice. And I think that these concepts will will be more clear once we do so. The third item that I want to talk about in terms of refinements in the capital budgeting process is capital rationing. And once again, capital rationing is something that came up earlier on in the course. Basically, there's two situations you can have when you're dealing with a capital budgeting scenario. One is that you have unlimited funds. The other is that you operate under capital rationing restrictions, which means that you have limited funds available to invest in a particular portfolio of projects. Okay. So firms often operate under conditions of capital rationing. In other words, they have more acceptable independent projects than they can fund. Okay. And this is by far the most, most common scenario. It's very rare that firms actually have unlimited financing. In theory, theoretically speaking, anyway, capital rationing shouldn't exist because firms should theoretically be able to accept all projects that have positive npvs In other words, if you've gone to the trouble of identifying projects that have positive npvs, you would think that you'd be able to borrow the money to invest in that particular project because it is one that creates value.

However, we know that that's really not the case in practice. Okay. Research has found that management internally imposes capital expenditure constraints to avoid what it deems to be excessive levels of new financing, particularly debt. And we also know that there's also external constraints as well. You can only borrow so much before the bank or other lending institutions may decide that they've lent you enough money. That being said, then, recognizing that in reality, companies almost always operate under capital rationing, both from the corporate perspective and also within departmental and divisional perspective. When a department or division may have a fixed budget, for instance, the objective of capital rationing is to select the group of projects within the firm's budget that provides the highest overall NPV or internal rate of return. So in other words, the idea is basically to maximize the use of the budget. So there are those two approaches to figure out or two approaches to help guide capital rationing decisions. We have the NPV and we have the internal rate of return method. And this example will give us an illustration of how we would use those. Okay, so in this case, we have a company which is a fast growing plastics company with a cost of capital of 10%. It's confronted with six projects competing, competing for its fixed budget of $250,000. Okay. So whenever you have a fixed budget, you're operating under capital rationing restrictions.

The initial investment and internal rate of return for each project are shown below. So once again, note that we normally will have more independent projects available than we can actually fund. Okay, The question is which ones should we fund to maximize our overall return? Now, under the internal rate of return approach, basically what you do is you calculate the internal rate of return for all the projects and then you sort them on the basis of the internal rate of return. And you basically fund each project with the highest internal rate of return until you exhaust the budget. Okay? So under the internal rate of return method, this approach would select Project B, Project C and Project E, Now you can use you can see that in order to fund those projects, we would require an initial investment of $230,000. That falls within our fixed budget of $250,000. Okay. If we tried to fund Project A the next project that would exceed the budget so we can only fund B, C and E under the internal rate of return method, which once again sorts the projects on the basis of their internal rate of return and then simply funds the available projects on the basis of that internal rate of return method until the budget is exhausted. Okay. But note under the internal rate of return method, in this particular case, we would actually have an unused portion of our budget. We would actually have a portion that we're not spending on any particular project of $20,000.

The NPV approach is a little bit different. What you do under the NPV approach is you start by ranking the projects using their internal rate of return, and then it involves a bit of trial and error to figure out how to most efficiently use the budget so that your overall present value, your net present value is maximized under the NPV approach. Basically, it says that we should select projects B, C, and A okay, you'll see that B, C and A uses an initial investment of $70,000, $100,000 and $80,000 respectively. That uses a total of $250,000, which is equivalent to our fixed budget. So under the NPV approach, if we use B, C, and A, we're actually using our. Entire budget. And what we would be doing in this case is maxing, maximizing the overall NPV that we're earning on all of the investments. Okay. So to compute the NPV for the selected projects, what we do is we add the sum of their present value, okay, which is given in the last column there. And then you subtract from that the budget used. Okay? In other words, you subtract from that the initial investment to get a sense of what the overall NPV is. Okay. So the scene as seen in this example, then the problem with the internal rate of return approach is that it doesn't necessarily guarantee the maximum dollar return to the firm.

Basically, it just provides a satisfactory solution to the capital rationing program problem. And the reason it doesn't necessarily guarantee the maximum dollar return to the firm is it doesn't guarantee that you're going to use the entire budget. Okay. The NPV approach is implemented once again by ranking the projects, first of all, on the basis of the internal rate of return and then evaluating the present value of the benefits from each potential project to determine the combination of projects with the highest overall NPV. Okay. So this is basically the same as maximizing an FIB NPV because the entire budget is viewed as the initial total investment. One of the things that's commonly used in capital rationing examples is something called a investment opportunity schedule. Or I there's an example of that here on the screen. Basically what this involves is preparing a graph depicting the internal rates of return in descending order against the total or total dollar investment. So if we were to take a look at at this particular chart, you would see that we have our internal rate of return for each individual project. You would see that we have the cumulative cumulative investment and then to help us decide which projects to invest, you would basically go, okay, we go to our $250,000 budget. We go up, we see, okay, we can't totally fund Project A, but we can fund everything to the left of that. We can fund Project B, Project C and and Project E, If you take a look at your course package, I did prepare an example and I did include an example entitled Risk and Refinements in Capital Budgeting and I think this is a very good integrative example that takes into account radar's risk adjusted discount rates, which we discussed in a previous lecture.

It gives you examples on how to compute the real options, and it also gives you an illustrative example of how to take into account capital rationing. Okay? So for that reason, I think it's important that you very carefully review this example to get a sense of how to put into practice those principles associated with radar's real options and capital rationing. I'm not going to read to you the entire example, but instead we'll just hit on a couple of key points. Basically, you can see that you've been given all kinds of information for a particular manufacturing company, which is looking to evaluate two alternative plans. We've got Project X, we've got Project Y, we've got initial investments for each of those plans, which is once again, basically the cash outflow at time zero. And then we've got a whole bunch of cash inflows arising from that initial investment. Of course, the cash inflows differ for each particular project and in this case they occur over a period of five years. You can see that we have risk adjusted discount rates for each plan. Okay. So we've got a plan X risk adjusted discount rate of 13%, plan Y, risk adjusted discount rate of 15%.

Basically, that means that Project Y or plan Y is going to be riskier than Plan X, And because of that, we've raised basically the hurdle rate for the acceptance of this project through this risk adjusted discount rate of 15%. We've also been given information pertaining to real options. Okay, so plan X and plan Y. Each has a real option. In this case, the real option for Plan X is an abandonment option. Basically, at the end of three years, the firm could abandon this plan and install the automatic equipment, which has a proven track record. By that time, this abandonment option is expected to add $101,000 of NPV and has a 25% chance of being exercised. Okay. So the key is it potentially adds $100,000 to the NPV and it has a 25% chance of being exercised. Plan Y is a little bit different. Okay. This option here basically is associated with an expansion option where we have an estimate that we may be able to earn an additional $500,000 of NPV with a 20% chance of being exercised. Okay. So we've got an abandonment option and then we've got an expansion option. And this example shows us how to compute those real options here, in addition to giving us some insight into radars and capital rationing. Okay. So you can see there's a whole bunch of questions. I'm not going to read all of those to you individually. You can go through those examples on your own time.

And I certainly do encourage you to very carefully review this example, as you would do for any of the other examples. Keep in mind that any examples that have been provided in the course package, whether or not they're explicitly reviewed in class, are eligible to be tested. And for that reason it is important that you do go through them. Basically, in this case, we were asked to answer five questions or six questions for this particular problem. The first question dealt with finding the NPV and internal rate of return at a interest rate of 12%. Okay. And you can see that's going to be computed. Exactly as we've done throughout the course. You have your cash outflows. We have our cash inflows. We have to figure out the NPV taking into account that interest rate of 12% and the time period of five years. If you do that, you find that the NPV comes to just over 349,000 for Plan X and just south of 429,000 for Plan Y. Internal rates of return once again calculated on these cash flows using the internal rate of return function in Excel once again, exactly the same as the examples that we've looked at previously. Part B we're asked to calculate the risk adjusted discount rate. Pardon me use. We're asked to use the risk adjusted discount rate to calculate the NPV. So we were given radars of 13% and 15% for plans X and Y respectively.

So basically all that means is that instead of using 12% as the interest rate, you use these given numbers for radars as the interest rate. And what we find is that the NPV for Plan X using interest rate of 13% is $261,105. And using plan Y, once again using all those cash flows given in the problem on the first page, using a radar of 15%, we find that the NPV is $225,412. Part B We're asked to compare and contrast the findings in part parts A and B, we see that there's no conflicting rankings in this case from NPV and internal rate of return. However, we find that the final plan would be plan X on the basis of the risk adjusted discount method, which is a different answer than we'd gotten if we didn't use radar. If we didn't use radar, you'd see that Plan Y was had the highest NPV and is therefore desirable. But if we use the risk adjusted discount rates, Plan X is actually the plan that we would want to go with. The next thing that we're asked to do is find the strategic NPV. Okay? And this is where we get into the calculation of real options. And this gives you an illustration of some of that theory that we were talking about earlier on in the lecture. Okay. So to compute the value of the real options, basically what you do for Plan X is you take the value of the real options is equal to the probability that it's implemented minus the NPV or multiplied by the NPV.

In this case, we were told that the probability that the real option for Plan X would be implemented is 25%. Okay. So remember, the probability that that abandonment option would be implemented was 25%. And we were told that if it is implemented, it would give us an additional $100,000 of NPV. So 25% multiplied by $100,000 gives us $25,000. We were told earlier in the lecture that the NPV strategically, the strategic NPV is the traditional NPV plus the value of the real options. So the traditional NPV is that NPV we calculated using the radar. That's 261 105. So again, that was calculated here in Part B, That's the traditional NPV that we calculated using the radar to that we have to add the value of the real options of $25,000. So the strategic NPV is the sum of the traditional NPV and the real options, NPV, which gives us a total NPV for Plan X of $286,105 plan. Plan Y. Recall we had that expansion option. We were told there's a 20% chance that it would be implemented and that if it actually is implemented, it would generate an additional $500,000 in NPV. Okay. So if that happens, we take 20%, multiply it by 500,000. That gives us the value of the real options for plan Y as $100,000. The strategic NPV, once again, is the traditional NPV, plus the real options, NPV.

In this case, that's 225,412, which for our traditional NPV was calculated in Part B, So that was calculated up here. Take that and we add to it this value of the real options that we calculated 20% of $500,000, $100,000. That gives us a strategic NPV equal to $325,412. Part E You're asked to compare and contrast the findings in D with B. Okay. Remember, before Project X was acceptable as the desirable one on the basis of radar. But now if we take into account these real options, we would find that Project Y is actually now favored. Okay, so whether or not you take into account the real options can have a very real impact on which project you would select under any particular under those scenarios. Part F the last question we were asked would our recommendations change under capital rationing? Basically, whenever you have capital rationing, you have to consider the budget that's available. Plan Y is cheaper than Plan X, so we'd have to take into account the available budget versus the available investment opportunities. So that's all I wanted to say today about refinements in capital budgeting. Once again, the most common refinements that you'll be asked to compute, at least in this course, involve the comparison of mutually exclusive projects with unequal lives. You may be asked to consider the incorporation of real options into any particular investment alternative, and you may also be asked to do capital rationing. And keep in mind that in practice, of course, capital rationing is almost certainly the scenario that your firm will operate under.",7705,"[-0.00556045 -0.02580738  0.00380086 ... -0.00501037 -0.00203795

Economic Analysis in the Public Sector,7.0,CEFA,"Title: Economic Analysis in the Public Sector; Description: In this video, the lecturer discusses economic analysis in the public sector and highlights the differences between public and private projects. While private sector companies aim to generate profits and benefit their stakeholders, public organizations such as governments and school districts focus on promoting the general welfare. Investment decisions in the public sector are complicated by various factors not relevant to the private sector. The lecturer introduces the concept of public projects, authorized and financed by the government, and emphasizes their purpose of promoting general welfare. Differences between public and private projects include the source of capital, with public projects relying on taxes, fees, and borrowing, as well as longer project lifecycles and a wider scale of beneficiaries. Politics also play a significant role in public projects, and decision-making can become politicized. Projects in the public sector often serve multiple purposes, making it challenging to determine whether they promote general welfare. Evaluating public projects is difficult due to features like the absence of profit standards and the complexity of quantifying costs and benefits. The connection between public projects and the public itself is another complication, as public participation and political considerations come into play. To evaluate public projects, cost-benefit analysis is commonly used, comparing the costs and benefits with and without the project. One specific tool used in economic analysis is the benefit-cost ratio, which assesses the ratio between the discounted total benefits and costs. It is a way to measure the equivalent worth of the net benefits compared to the equivalent worth of the net costs. In the modified version, the benefit-cost ratio also considers operating and maintenance costs. Overall, evaluating public projects is more challenging than evaluating private sector projects due to the multitude of stakeholders involved and the complexities of assessing costs and benefits.; Transcript: Well, hello again. In this lecture, we're going to be discussing economic analysis in the public sector. And as we're going through this lecture, it's useful to keep in mind that the basic objectives of the public and private sector are fundamentally different. So, so far we've considered economic analysis for companies in the private sector where the main objectives are to generate profits for growth and to reward current stakeholders. Of course, investment decisions for private sector companies involve evaluating the costs and benefits associated with prospective project in terms of life cycle cash flow streams. And that's something that we've seen in the many examples that we've done so far, particularly on those related to the capital budgeting and investment analysis examples. But consider that public organizations such as governments, port authorities and school districts, also need to make investment decisions. And for these decision making bodies, investments are complicated by many factors that do not affect companies in the private sector. So we'll talk about some of those factors in a in a general introduction to economic analysis in the public sector. We'll also talk about issues associated with selecting an appropriate interest rate. To do these analyses. We'll talk about the benefit cost ratio, which is the most common method used to assess and to conduct economic analysis in the public sector. And then we'll close by very briefly discussing incremental benefit cost analysis. So the first thing that we need to understand is what is a public project? And basically a public project is any project that is authorized, financed or operated by federal, state or local government agencies.

The reason that we have these is that certain activities are generally recognized as being best pursued by government or a nonprofit profit agencies, things like defense, waterways or highways. However, it is important to note that what activities are best is not always easy to define. With that in mind, then we can begin to think about some of the ways that a public project may differ from private projects. One and probably the most important one, is that we need to consider is the purpose of the investment. Keep in mind that in private sector companies, investment decisions are based on increasing the wealth and economic stability of the organization. Beneficiaries of the investment are often clearly defined as the stockholders of the company. However, when we're looking at economic analysis from a public perspective and in the public sector, we need to use essentially the catch phrase promoting general welfare. That's basically the guideline in public decision making. So the general objective stated another way is to promote the general welfare and ensure that the value to those who can potentially benefit exceeds the overall cost to those who do not benefit. And once again, that's really the benefit or the purpose, the main purpose of investment in the public sector. Another key difference between private projects and public projects is the source of capital sources of revenue for public projects.

Generally speaking, are taxes, fees and borrowing. The project life is typically longer for public projects. Not always, but typically it is. The nature of the benefits, once again are certainly different and of course the beneficiaries of the investment are typically of a much wider scale as well. Public projects tend to have much larger, larger bases of stakeholders to consider than private organizations. Effects of politics certainly make their way into any public project whenever public money is involved and whenever benefits and negative consequences of a decision are attached to these types of considerations, the public do tend to get involved and things do tend to get politicized very quickly on any particularly large public projects. And another key difference between public projects and private projects is the multi, multi purpose nature of investments in the public sector. So, for instance, most public projects have multiple purposes or objectives. One example could be building a dam to create a reservoir on a river provides not only flood control, irrigation, electric power, recreation, but also potentially drinking water. So there's all kinds of benefits potentially associated with public projects. That being said, of course, it's not always easy to distinguish which investments promote general welfare and those that do not. For example, if we're looking at a public utility considering building a hydro dam, for instance, note that the dam may have many benefits, but it might also result in the loss of land upstream environmental damage or negative impacts on the water supply of communities downstream.

So there's all kinds of things that we need to take into account when we are taking into consideration this notion of promoting general welfare. That being said, then there are many difficulties in evaluating public projects, and many of the inherent differences between public and private projects do make public projects particularly challenging to evaluate. And for that reason, public investment decisions are often a little bit more difficult than private sector. Once again, owing to the vast array of stakeholders affected by the investment. Some of the things that we need to take into account then are this notion of the profit standard. Rarely there's profits in the public standards in the public sector. So where is the overall goal of private companies is to maximize shareholder wealth. Wealth maximization isn't necessarily going to be the goal of a public. Project. Public projects can be difficult, difficult to quantify. Sometimes it's very tough to put monetary values on some of the benefits versus the costs. The connection between the project and the public is another issue that tends to complicate public projects. Projects where the public in general benefits tend to involve much more increased levels of public participation. So, for instance, if you want to build a highway, you may need to consult with the general public. And once again, the process may become very politicized, which again leads us into the concepts of politics, legal issues and of course sources of capital is another issue that makes an analyzing public projects a little bit more complicated.

Complicating or more challenging to evaluate because as we'll see in in a minute, sometimes it's tough to know what interest rate to use in order to do the calculations, in order to figure out the relative values of the benefits versus the costs. That being said, public projects are usually evaluated through a cost benefit analysis. That's generally speaking, the most common technique used in the economic analyses in the public sector. Cost benefit analysis is basically a decision tool that assesses projects through a comparison between their costs and benefits. They do include social costs and benefits, and because of that, sometimes they are rather difficult to quantify. That being said, some general guidelines that we need to keep in mind is that the cost benefit analysis compares the costs and benefits of the situation with and without the project. The cost and benefits are compared over the life of the project and generally the life of the project is you take a very broad viewpoint of that life and a very broad viewpoint of the various costs and benefits associated with the implementation of that particular project. And of course, the other key point is that we have to be careful not to record any costs or benefits more than once. So so those are some general guidelines that we keep in mind when we talk about cost benefit analysis in general and the specific tool that's generally used to do a cost benefit analysis in economic analysis in the public sector is something called the benefit cost ratio.

That's what we most commonly use to evaluate public projects. One of the primary reasons that it's used is its simplicity. As you can see on the screen here, the benefit cost ratio is the ratio between the discounted total benefits and costs. So the benefit cost ratio can basically to be defined as the equivalent worth of the net benefits divided by the equivalent worth of the net cost. When we're talking when we're talking about equivalent worth, we can use any of the methods that we've used earlier on in the course with respect to present value, future value or annualized value. And if we're talking about annualized value, then we're talking basically about the capital recovery factor. Okay? So the present value of future value techniques, as you'll see in the examples, actually are used as a part of these benefit cost ratios because we do look at calculating the discounted total benefits and costs. The benefit cost ratio can be defined as basically the benefits minus the Dis benefits over the cost. And it is important to note that there is a modified benefit cost ratio that is commonly used. It's often defined as the benefits minus the dis benefits, minus the O&M costs, O&M being operating and maintenance costs divided by the initial cost.

So in the modified version, then the numerator and denominator are defined in a slightly different manner. Okay. The annual operating and maintenance costs to the users are subtracted in the numerator, as you can see on the screen here. And it is important to note that the numeric answer for the two methods between the the modified method and the typically used benefit cost ratio are not always going to give you the same answer, but they will give you the same decision. Okay. So they may not give you the exact same numeric answer, but they should give you the same decision in that both will produce the same recommendation on whether to invest or not in a particular project. So building on that slide, then some of the key components of the benefit cost ratio are described here on this screen. You can see that the key components, of course, include the benefits, the costs and the dis benefits. Benefits are basically the positive advantages or outcomes of a project which justify its implementation. They can be tangible or intangible. The costs are basically are paid for by the sponsor of the project. They're typically divided into initial costs and then operating and maintenance costs. And the dis benefits are basically the negative consequences of a project to the public. Keep in mind that when we're looking at promoting general welfare, as we do look at in public projects, we need to take into account both the benefit, both the benefits and the negatives as well.

So you take into account the positives and the negatives associated with any particular investment. So for example, if we were to build a new city airport at the exterior of town, some of the primary benefits might be more flights, potentially new businesses, but we might have some dis benefits as well. Okay. If it's built outside of town, we might have exterior travel time to the airport. It may also result in more traffic on the outer belt as another another example, let's say we look at building an interstate bypass around town. This could result in benefits such as quicker commute times. Reduce congestion on surface roads, but it may lead to a number of disbenefits, such as lost sales to businesses on surface roads, potentially a loss of agricultural lands as well associated with the the construction of of that highway and putting into practice. Another example, we could look at the creation of a city disposal facility versus sending the waste out of town. Primary benefits is potentially this is less costly, might be faster and more responsive to customers, but there might be dis benefits associated with that as well, such as objectionable sites and smells potentially a loss in market value to homeowners close to the disposal facility, potentially a loss once again of agricultural or forest lands or other lands that could be used for another another use.

So once again, we need to take into account all of the benefits and disbenefits associated with any particular public project. And once again, we do take a very broad viewpoint of those benefits and those costs. That being said, then the decision rule in terms of using the benefit cost ratio basically is that if the benefit cost ratio is greater than one, then the decision should be to invest. Okay. So if the benefits are greater than the costs, you should invest. If the benefit cost ratio is less than one, then the decision should be not to invest. Okay. If if we actually wind up with a case where the benefit cost ratio is exactly equal to one. This is analogous to the case of calculated present value of zero or of an internal rate of return of equal to the minimum acceptable rate of return. Basically, in that situation, if the benefit cost ratio was exactly equal to one, you could go either way. Okay, so if it's greater than one, you would typically invest. If it's less than one, then you wouldn't invest. If it's exactly equal to one, which is probably going to be fairly rare in practice, then you could go either way. Now, of course, if we're going to do any equivalent worth calculations, if we're going to do any calculations on the present value or the future value, we need to have an interest rate. Okay. And before we get into the actual calculation of the benefit cost ratio, therefore we must acknowledge that a key challenge in these types of analyses is to determine the appropriate interest rate for use in analysis of public projects.

Okay. So for private sector companies, we know that the overall objective is wealth maximization. And in these cases, basically we choose an appropriate interest rate for use in evaluating projects. That's consistent with that goal. Okay. Public investment, though, is to promote general welfare. So it's a bit of a different goal, right? We're not looking to maximize wealth. We're looking to promote general welfare, in this case, the setting of an interest rate for the use in the investment analysis is less clear cut. Some of the complications that arise when we're trying to figure out what appropriate interest rate we should use in the analysis of public projects are summarized here on the screen. You'll see that one of them is that there's no time value of money concept. Okay, so in government, money is typically obtained through taxation and it's spent about as quickly as it's obtained. So there's relatively little delay between the collection and the actual spending. The cost of capital concept is another thing that we need to take into account. The fact that, for example, the federal government may subsidize state and local borrowing in some cases, and that could actually distort the number, actually distort the cost of the borrowed money that you're using in your calculations.

Opportunity cost is another very important concept that we need to take into account, and this of course relates to the best opportunity foregone. And you can look at this from two perspectives. You can look at this as an opportunity cost from the perspective of the government. And you can look at this as an opportunity cost from the perspective of the taxpayer. Okay. If we're looking at it in the case of the government, the opportunity cost is basically set as the best prospective project for which funding is not available. Of course, those rates, though, might differ across government when we're looking at it from the perspective of the taxpayer. The opportunity cost basically suggests that a correct interest rate to use in evaluating public investments is that which the taxpayer could not could have received if the government had not collected those dollars through taxation, for example. It wouldn't make sense. It's not really economically desirable to take money from a taxpayer who has a 12% opportunity cost and then invest it in a government project earning 4%. Okay, so that's kind of what we mean when we're talking about the opportunity cost from the perspective of the taxpayer and recall. We also need to consider from the taxpayer from the perspective of the government, generally speaking, the recommended concept, the concept that's normally used, the general rule of thumb is to select the largest of the cost of capital, the government opportunity cost or the taxpayer opportunity cost in setting the interest rate for government investments.

But it is important to note that there is no universal rule. With that in mind, then summarizing the approach to the benefit cost ratio computation computations. Basically what we do is we start by identifying all the users and sponsors of a project, keeping in mind, of course, that there is typically a very wide range of stakeholders. So there's going to be a lot of users, potentially a lot of sponsors for any particular project. Keeping those stakeholders in mind, we then have to identify all the benefits and disbenefits associated with a particular project. And once again, these aren't always going to be clear. Okay, there may be some debate and discussion about. What benefits are exactly associated with the project and what negatives are associated with that project as well. And then the next step is to quantify those benefits and disbenefits in dollars or some other unit of measure. And of course it's not always going to be easy to put benefits and disbenefits into monetary terms. So as you can see, as we're going through this, there's a lot of opportunity for debate and discussion and controversy when you're actually putting together the benefit cost ratio that may or may not necessarily be as present in some of the private sector calculations that we looked at earlier on. Once again, typically the public sector calculations might be a little bit more controversial because it may be difficult to really quantify some of those benefits and those dis benefits.

Once we've done that, we select an appropriate interest rate at which to discount future benefits and costs to a present value, as we saw on the previous screen. That's not so easy either. Okay. So the easiest thing in this this economic analysis in the public sector is the the actual calculation itself. But it's pretty tough to come up with monetary values for the benefits, the dis benefits, the the interest rates to use. There's all kinds of room for debate and discussion throughout this process. So it is particularly important that you spend a lot of time thinking about the assumptions made in these calculations and making sure that they are they are acceptable. And these are things that do make sense and that the once again, that the calculation is only going to be as good as the numbers upon which it's based in your course package. I did provide an example on the economic analysis in the public sector, and I'm just going to very briefly go over to this example because it shows you how to apply the benefit cost ratio in practice. So in this case, you can see that we have a highway expansion project that has the benefits and costs listed below, and we've been asked to determine the benefit cost ratio so the benefits and costs are given. We have initial costs of expansion of $1.5 million.

We have some annual costs for operating and maintenance of $65,000. We can see that annual savings and benefits to travelers have been assigned a value of $225,000. Scrap value is $300,000. Useful life of the investment is 30 years. The interest rate is 8%. Okay. So the question is what is the benefit cost ratio? Okay. So what you do is basically you compare the benefits and costs in this case in terms of their present value. Okay? So you compute the present value of the benefits and then you compute the present value of the costs and then you can get the benefit cost ratio. Okay? So this makes use of the techniques that we've been using earlier, been using earlier on in the course. So for the present value of the benefits, we're told that we use an interest rate of 8%. Okay. Savings is 225,000 per year and the scrap value is given as $300,000 per year. Okay. So basically we take our cash flow then to be our savings to be in terms of the benefits to be 225,000 per year. So you can see it's 225,000 a year in years, one through 29. In year 30, it bumps up to 525,000 because we also need to take into account the scrap value. Okay, So we treat that kind of as like a cash inflow. That's a benefit. Okay. You then compute the present value of all those cash flows and once again, the present value is going to be equal to the future value.

So this cash flow divided by one plus I raised to the N. Okay, so that's exactly the same as all those calculations we did in capital budgeting and the time value of money. You add that all that up and the NPV or the net present value of those benefits tends to be a little bit over $2.5 million. You do the exact same thing for the costs. Okay? This time we figure out the present value of the costs. Once again, the interest rate is 8%. We see in this case, our initial costs are $1.5 million and then we have annual costs of $65,000. Okay. Then we have to figure out essentially the present value. Okay. So you take the initial cost is 1.5 million. Then you can see we have 65,000 all the way through years, one through 30 of those operating costs. Okay. Those annual costs, again, you take the present value. So that's going to be the future value of these cash flows divided by one plus I raised to the N, okay, you sum all that up and you get an NPV of just over $2.2 million. If you take the NPV for the benefits and you divide that by the NPV of the costs. So 2.56, 2 million divided by 2.231 million, you get a benefit cost ratio of 1.15. This is very similar to the homework problem that you're going to be asked to complete at the end of the lecture.

Now, benefit cost calculations are relatively straightforward, at least once you actually have the numbers. If they are independent projects, not subject to cash and capital rationing. So if we're looking at the evaluation of independent projects, of course none of the projects, any combination of the projects or all the projects can be selected if there's no capital rationing. Basically we select those projects that have a benefit cost ratio greater than or equal to 1.0. However, if we do have capital rationing, things get a little bit more complex, okay? Because now we have to look at the mutually exclusive alternatives and take an extra look at them through incremental analysis. Okay. So if you have capital rationing and you have mutually exclusive projects, you have to do an incremental analysis. If you're interested in using rates of return as the basis for your your decision making. Okay. So under the evaluation of mutually exclusive projects, we cannot simply choose the one with the greater benefit cost ratio. As with the rate of return methods, this evaluation requires that an incremental benefit cost analysis be conducted or and this is an important point that's why it's underlined, or we can just take the largest present value. Okay. So if it's mutually exclusive projects, you can compare them directly on the basis of the NPV, just like you could when we were doing our incremental analysis earlier on in the course when we were talking about capital budgeting.

Okay, Remember, we did that incremental internal rate of return analysis. We talked about the fact that you can compare mutually exclusive projects directly using the NPV method. Of course, assuming they had the same life, if they don't have the same life, we had to get into the A NPV method. But in this case, if they had the same life, you could compare it directly using the NPV. You can do the exact same thing here. Okay? You can compare it on the basis of the present value directly. If, however, you want to use the rate of return method, which many people do prefer for whatever reason, a preference for rates of return, you have to use the incremental method and the incremental method. In this case, once again should be used in comparing sets of mutually exclusive alternatives. And it's very similar to the approach that we we used earlier on for our incremental internal rate of return method. It's just slightly augmented for use with the benefit cost ratio. All that being said, then the key elements of the incremental benefit cost ratio method are summarized here on the screen. We start by identifying all the relevant alternatives. Okay, so you get everything that's potentially a solution and you get it down. You identify the benefit cost ratio for each competing alternative. You then rank order the projects, make a pairwise comparison, select the appropriate alternative on the basis of that pairwise comparison.

And once again, this is very similar to the approach used in the incremental internal rate of return analysis that we looked at earlier on in the course. And we're going to see that in an example in the example, the key decision rule is that of course if the change between these is greater than one, if the difference between them, if the increment is greater than one, then we would select B, If it's less than one, of course being B minus A, then we would select A okay, so the exact same type of decision rule as we had earlier on with our incremental internal rate of return analysis. I think that the incremental benefit cost analysis is best represented through an example and an example was provided in your Excel spreadsheet package. Okay. So once again, I do encourage you to pull out your Excel spreadsheets to follow along as best you can. As always, you can click on any of the individual cells within the Excel spreadsheet and see how those numbers were put together in this case. Okay, The example is called incremental benefit cost analysis, and we've been asked to consider three investment projects. Okay, these are labeled one, two and three. Each project has the same service life, and the present worth of the initial investment benefits and annual costs is computed at 10% and that's given. Okay. So for each project we're given an initial cost.

So Project one is 5000, Project two is 20,000, Project three is 14,000. We've been given benefits of 12,000, 35,020 1000 respectively, annual costs of four, eight and 1000 respectively. And we've also been given the present value at the interest rate of 10% of 3000, 7006 thousand for projects one, two and three respectively. Then we're asked basically two questions If the projects are independent, which would be selected on the basis of the benefit cost ratio, if you have independent projects, okay, you just compare it directly. You don't have to bother with the incremental benefit cost analysis that's used for mutually exclusive projects. And that's part B, Okay. If the projects are mutually exclusive. Okay. Remembering if we pick, basically that means if we pick one, we can't pick any of the other ones, which would be the best alternative. Once again, we have to use the benefit cost ratio on the incremental investment. So the solution for Part A, okay, we're told that the present value of each at 10% is positive, therefore they're all acceptable. So there's no inferior project to eliminate. Okay. Remember, that's always the first step in an incremental analysis. Take a look. Make sure you don't have any inferior projects. If you do, you can cancel those immediately and not worry about them. If, however, you do have no inferior projects, then you have to consider everything available. Okay. So in this case, all these projects are acceptable.

We know that. The benefit cost ratio is greater than one, and we can basically calculate the benefit cost ratio, taking the benefits divided by the cost. And you can see here the benefits for Project one, two and three have been calculated in in Excel. And once again, if you click on those particular answers, you can see the formula that was used to put it together. Okay. So I know it's probably tough to see on the screen directly, but if you open up the Excel spreadsheet on your computer yourself, you can click on that on that particular cell and you can see all the formulas that were used to put these things together. Okay. So I once again strongly encourage you to review the Excel spreadsheets to make sure you understand how those numbers were calculated. Part B, we're told, if the projects are mutually exclusive. Okay, now, now, which one would we choose? Okay. So basically, we have to use this principle of incremental analysis. Okay. That we talked about just a moment ago. So the first thing that we do is we we arrange the projects in increasing order of their denominators, denominators for the benefit cost criteria. Okay. So we go total cost. The cheapest one was project one. That was 9000 total cost Project three was the second. Okay, cheapest and project two was the most expensive. Okay. So we basically take into account the total costs for projects one, two and three and we order it cheapest to most expensive.

Then what you do is you make a pairwise comparison. Okay? So you start by comparing project three to project one to figure out which is the best project. Okay. So once again, that's done on the basis of looking at the differences between these alternatives. And if you click on the cell, you can see the exact formula. Okay, so we're looking at the differences between the benefits and the differences between the costs. Okay. And that's based on this decision rule here. Okay. Remember, we have to look at the differences between the benefits over the differences between the costs. If it's greater than one, okay, then we would select the more the more expensive one. If not, we would select the cheaper one. So in this case, we go, we do this comparison and we find that project. We find that the benefit cost ratio of three minus one, a project three minus one is greater than one. Therefore we would expect Project three. Okay. That's basically the same logic that we used in our incremental internal rate of return analysis earlier on in the course. So in this case, Project three is acceptable. Next, what you do is you have to compare 3 to 2. Okay? And if we had another project, then we would keep going, okay. Just as we did in an earlier example when we looked at our incremental analysis, you can have as many situations as you like, as you like here.

You just organize them according to the lowest cost and then you make that pairwise comparison. So here we compare 3 to 2 and we find that the benefit over the cost ratio, the change between them of two minus three. And once again you click on the cell, you can see the formula. Basically you take all the benefits, the incremental difference between them. You divide that by the incremental difference between the costs. You see that once again, the benefit cost ratio is greater than one in this case because the benefit cost ratio is greater than one. We would therefore prefer project two. Okay. So since the ratio is greater than one, we prefer 2 to 3. Project two is there for the final choice. Now you have to go through all this. If you prefer to use the benefit cost ratio method on an incremental basis. Of course, as I said earlier, when you're looking at mutually exclusive projects, you can also compare them directly on the basis of NPV. And that's what this this line says here at the bottom of the of the spreadsheet. And that, again, once again is basically highlighting this point here that you can take the largest present value. And if you if you don't want to just do that, if you want to use the benefit cost ratio for mutually exclusive projects, you have to do it on that incremental basis.

So that being said, then, this last slide here just summarizes a couple of the key issues that we need to keep in mind with our benefit cost method. Of course, as we've discussed throughout the lecture, economic analysis in the private and public sector are different. If we're using public sector, we do tend to do it on the basis of this benefit cost ratio method, keeping in mind that the overall goal is to maximize the general welfare rather than maximizing stakeholder wealth, which of course is our goal in the private sector. The benefit cost methods in theory will yield the same decisions as the equivalent worth approaches upon which they're built. There are, however, several difficulties in analyzing public project analysis, including some of the ones summarized here and we talked about these throughout the lecture. Of course, we know that it's easier said than done, easier said than done to identify all the benefits and disbenefits of a project. It's very difficult to sometimes put a monetary value on those benefits and on those Disbenefits for example, we talked about that, that example. Let's say that you wanted to build a disposal facility, okay? In the city versus sending the waste out of state benefits might be that it's less costly, faster and more responsive to customers. But how do you put a value on those disbenefits things like objectionable sight and smells? Okay, that's that's tough to put a value on.

How would you actually put a monetary value on that lost market value of homeowners? You could probably put a market value on that loss of. Pristine forestland or pristine agricultural land again. Sometimes it's tough to put values on these. These types of these types of issues. So it is easier said than done than to put the value on these benefits and disbenefits. Usually that's done through an extensive period of consultation. So you would consult internally within your governmental organization and often there is a large public consultation associated, particularly with major public projects. So major new highways, major new transmission systems, for instance, major new dams. These types of things tend to have a very extensive public consultation process that can be used to help begin to put a value on these benefits and these disbenefits. As we also discussed, selecting an appropriate interest rate is also difficult. And in general, of course, the key point here developing, evaluating and selecting a portfolio of projects is very difficult. And many of the things that we talked about in today's lecture, of course, reveal the fact that economic analysis in the public sector is often a little bit more challenging than the private sector. That being said, you can still use many of the same tools that we've we've been looking at earlier on in the course. But there is that that new method, that benefit cost ratio method to consider when we are looking at the economic analysis in the public sector.",7338,"[-3.11997766e-03 -5.64247882e-03  3.47962196e-05 ... -2.12279893e-02

Stocks,7.2,CEFA,"Title: Stocks; Description: The key takeaways from this video are the importance of stocks in maximizing shareholder wealth, the features and characteristics of debt and equity, and the ownership structure of corporations. Stocks represent ownership in a firm and the goal is to maximize shareholder wealth. Debt is less risky than equity as it has a specified maturity date and is senior to equity in terms of claims on income and assets. Debt is also tax deductible, making it cheaper for the firm. Common stockholders are the true owners of the firm and expect dividends and capital gains. Privately owned, closely owned, and publicly owned corporations have different ownership structures. Terms associated with common stock, such as par value and authorized, outstanding, and issued shares, are explained. Preferred stock has features of both debt and equity and pays a fixed dividend. Stock valuation is influenced by factors such as dividends, growth, and changing interest rates. Common stock valuation considers dividends and growth over time, while the free cash flow model values the company's free cash flows. Other approaches to stock valuation include the book value method, liquidation value method, and the P multiple method. All these methods have limitations and rely on assumptions and techniques. Engineering managers need to be aware of these factors as they are tied to the firm's goals.; Transcript: Greetings. In this lecture. We're going to spend some time talking about stocks. And this is a particularly important topic because it goes right back to the goal of the firm. Okay. Recall that the goal of the firm is essentially to maximize shareholder wealth and shareholder wealth is largely represented by share price. So one of the key things that you're going to need to take out of this lecture are basically those key factors that influence stock price because they directly reflect again on the goal of the firm in terms of maximizing shareholder wealth. We'll start things off by talking a little bit about the features of debt and equity. And these are some things that we've talked about throughout the course so far. But I did want to spend just a moment or two making sure that those points are clear. We'll then move on to a discussion of the features of common and preferred stock and recall that earlier on in the course we introduced the notion that there are different types of stock. So we'll talk a little bit about the features associated with those two different types with common stock and with preferred stock. And then we'll close the lecture by talking a little bit about stock valuation. Once again, as we are going through this, keep in mind that I'd like you to focus on the big the big picture related to the broad factors that influence stock price, because once again, maximizing stock price, in other words, maximizing owner wealth is one of the key for all keys for all managers and all engineers within a firm.

And because of that, anybody in engineering management needs to at least be aware of those broad factors that influence stock price. So the first thing that I'd like to talk about is just talk a little bit about the distinctions between debt and equity. And as I talked about in the previous lecture, bonds are a form of debt and stocks are a form of equity. Okay. So that's one of the key things that you need to understand, first of all, and I think that by this point, everybody should have an understanding of that. Keeping that in mind, then we've talked a little bit about debt and equity, but it is useful to reflect on the differences between them to really highlight the distinctions between these two forms of financing a business. The first characteristic that we need to consider is basically voice and management. The key point is that debt does not convey ownership and equity does. Okay, so debt does not convey ownership. Equity does. People who hold equity in the firm are the actual owners of the company. People who are owed debt to the company aren't actual owners to the company. They're just people to whom money is owed. Okay, so debt does not convey ownership. Equity does maturity. The maturity date for debt is always specified in advance. Okay. So whenever you, for instance, take out a loan or you issue a corporate bond, it's always specified in advance when you're going to have to pay back that loan.

Okay. Also specified in advance, of course, is any interest payments that you need to make on those loans. All that stuff will be identified up front. Equity doesn't necessarily have a maturity date. Okay. Typically, somebody who owns a stock in a company can often hold that for as long as they want. Claims on income and assets. Debt is senior to equity. Okay. In other words, equity is subordinate to debt. And this is one of the reasons why debt is said to have less risk than equity. Okay. So generally speaking, holding equity in a firm is more risky than holding debt in the firm. In the firm, because claims on the assets and income are senior when you hold debt. Okay, so if, for instance, the firm were to go bankrupt and they liquidated all the assets associated with that particular firm, the holders of debt would be paid back first. Okay. So you'd have to satisfy all those debt obligations before anybody holding equity could get any benefit. Last, we have this characteristic called tax treatment, and this is another key distinction Debt is tax deductible. So interest payments on debt is tax deductible, but dividend payments associated with equity are not tax deductible. And that's something that we saw from our study of the income statement. But maybe it was a point that we didn't emphasize quite heavily enough, but is one that's going to come back repeatedly over the next couple of lectures.

Debt is tax deductible and for that reason, debt is cheaper than equity from the perspective of the firm. So that provides a little bit of a basis for discussing the features of common stock and preferred stock over the next few slides. As I mentioned, there are two forms of stock are the two forms of stock are common stock and preferred stock. And we're going to discuss both of them. Common stockholders really are the true owners of the stock of the firm. Pardon me? Common stockholders, In other words, receive what is left. The residual, after all their claims on the firm's incomes and assets have been satisfied. Okay, so before anybody who holds common stock can get some benefit before they can receive dividends, for instance, all the other claims on the firm's income and assets have to be satisfied. And that goes back to that, that notion that debt is senior to equity. Okay? So before you can pay dividends, for instance, to common stockholders, you have to make sure that you've made all your interest payments first. You can't pay dividends if you haven't made the interest payments on your debt. Common stockholders expect to be compensated with adequate dividends and ultimately capital gains. These are basically the two ways that they can increase the return on their investment so they can get cash flow associated with dividends or they can get cash flow when they sell the stock for a price higher than they actually paid for it.

And that's essentially what we're referring to when we talk about capital gains, the common stock. Lack of a firm can be privately owned by an individual. Of course, it can be closely owned by a small group of investors, or it could be publicly owned by a very broad group of investors. Typically, small corporations are privately or closely owned, and if their shares are traded, this does occur relatively infrequently and in small amounts. Large corporations, however, are typically publicly owned and have shares that are actively traded on major exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange. Over the next few slides, I'm going to be running through some terms associated with common stock. And once again, this is just to give you an understanding of some of the terms that you may come across whenever you discuss stocks so that you have at least a passing familiarity with these concepts. The first one that I want to cover is par value. And the first point to note is that unlike Bonds, common stock may be sold without par value. So whenever you have a bond. Par value is a very important concept. All right. The par value. In other words, the face value is very important because that essentially sets how much money you must be repaid at the maturity date. In other words, it tells you what the principal of the bond is.

And it's also used to help set the interest rate. Okay. Remember, the interest rate or the coupon rate associated with bonds is typically quoted in a percentage basis. Okay. So the par value for a bond is very significant for common stock. It's not even sold with par values all the time. So the par value typically is not as critical for a common stock. The par value of a common stock is generally low. Typically you'll see a number such as $1, and it's a nominal value established in the firm's firm's corporate charter. And when a firm initially issues a stock, then when a stock is sold for more than its par value, as is often the case because it may be sold without a par value or it may be sold with a relatively low par value. So if a stock is sold for more than its par value, the difference is listed as what we call paid in capital in excess of par on the balance sheet. So if, for instance, a firm sold a stock for $10 that had a $1 par value, there would be two entries in the balance sheet. One would be a $1 entry for the par value of the stock. The other would be a $9 entry for paid in capital in excess of par. Okay. So whenever the par value, whenever a stock is sold for a value different than its par value by the issuing corporation, you have to take in this notion that paid in capital in excess of par is going to show up on your balance sheet.

The second feature of common stock that I want to spend a few moments considering is this notion of preemptive rights. And a preemptive right basically allows common stock holders to maintain their proportionate ownership in a corporation when new shares are issued. And this allows the existing shareholders to maintain voting control and protect against dilution of their ownership. Okay. So if a if a stockholder has a preemptive right, this will give them basically the first chance to purchase shares newly issued by the corporation to maintain their proportionate level of ownership in a rights offering. The firm grants rights to the existing shareholders, which permits them to purchase additional shares at a price below the current price. The next topic that I want to spend just a moment talking about is authorized, outstanding and issued shares. And the difference between them. Authorized shares are authorized. Shares are the number of shares of common stock that a firm's corporate charter allows, and the firm cannot sell more shares than the charter allows or than the charter authorizes without obtaining approval through a shareholder vote. So that is an important number because a firm is limited in the number of shares they can authorize based on the approval of their shareholders. Outstanding shares are the number of shares of common stock held by the public.

Okay, So of course, outstanding shares are typically less than authorized shares. A firm hasn't necessarily issued all of the shares that they can. Outstanding shares are the number of shares that are actually issued and that are therefore held by the public Treasury Stock is the number of outstanding shares that have been purchased by the firm. Okay. So sometimes a firm will issue shares and then they'll buy those shares back. Okay. When they do that, we call that Treasury stock. And it's important to note that Treasury shares can be reissued to the public without obtaining shareholder approval issued. Shares are the number of shares that have been put into circulation, and it includes both outstanding shares and Treasury stock. So that just gives you some insight into the differences between authorized, outstanding and issued shares. And also this notion of Treasury stock as well, voting rights. Basically, each share of common stock entitles its holder to one vote in the election of general director directors. And on special issues, votes are generally assignable and may be cast at annual stockholders meetings. Many firms do have or many firms have issued two or more classes of stock, differing mainly in having unequal voting rights. For example, usually Class A common stock is designated as non-voting, while Class B is designated as voting. It's important to note that Treasury stock does not have voting rights. Okay, so Treasury stock does not have voting rights. It does not earn dividends and does not have a claim on assets or claim against assets in liquidation since Treasury stock is owned by the firm.

Okay. So note that Treasury stock does not have voting rights, but typically other common stock will have voting rights and unless that there. Has made it as non-voting. Dividends are something that we've talked a little bit about throughout the course. And we're actually going to spend an entire lecture on dividends a little bit later on in the course. So I'm not going to spend too long on this, but I did want to spend a few minutes on it because dividends are very closely tied to two common and preferred stock. A payment of dividends, of course, is at the discretion of the board. So payment of dividends to common stockholders is not a requirement. Okay. That's decided by the firm's board. Okay. Each quarter or each year, whenever they would pay dividends, dividends may be made in cash, additional shares of stock or even merchandise. And we're going to talk about the different types of dividends when we do talk about dividends in its own lecture. And it should be noted that holders of common stock received dividend payments only after all claims have been settled with others. This goes back to that notion of seniority. Remember, for instance, you have to make interest payments on your debt before you can issue dividends. Okay. So basically, this is why we say that common stockholders receive the residual and what's left over after everything else has been satisfied.

Okay. So you can't pay any dividends until all of your other obligations have been met. So that's an introduction to some of the general features associated with common stock. Preferred stock is the second type of stock that we need to look at. And preferred stock is pretty unique because it actually has some features of debt and some features of equity. Okay. So in other words, it has certain privileges that make them senior to common stockholders. Preferred stock is an equity instrument that usually pays a fixed dividend and has a prior claim on the firm's earnings and assets in the case of liquidation. Okay, so preferred stock pays a fixed dividend. It's identified in advance what the dividend is going to be when you purchase preferred stock. Common stock does not have a fixed dividend. Okay. That's decided at the discretion of the firm's boards. Okay. So preferred stock has a fixed dividend. And it's also important to note that it has that prior claim on the firm's earnings and assets in the case of liquidation, which means that means that preferred stockholders have to get their benefits before the common stockholders. Okay. So when we say preferred, basically we mean preferred relative to common stockholders. The dividend on preferred stock is often expressed as either a dollar amount or as a percentage of the par value. Therefore, if it's expressed as a percentage of the par value, the par value of preferred stock can have real significance.

Okay. So we talked a little bit about the fact that par value for common stock generally isn't very important if a firm actually sells common stock for more than the par value, then they can issue this. They can create this entry in their balance sheet of paid in capital in excess of par. However preferred stock. The par value is significant if the dividend is expressed as a percentage of the par value. If a firm fails to pay preferred stock dividend, the dividend is said to be in arrears and before common stockholders can receive any dividend, basically you have to pay back that accumulated deficit to preferred stock stockholders. So you have to repay those those arrearages that you've that you've accumulated preferred stocks which possess this characteristic are often called cumulative preferred stocks. Preferred stocks are often referred to as a hybrid instrument or as hybrid securities, because, as I mentioned earlier, they do possess some characteristics of both common stocks and bonds. Okay. So, for instance, preferred stocks are a little bit like common stock because they are perpetual perpetual securities with no maturity date. Okay. Remember, debt has a maturity date, equity does not. So preferred stock is like common stock because they typically don't have a maturity date. But they're like bonds because they have because they are fixed income securities. In other words, the dividends never change. Okay. So the dividends don't change. That's identified in advance.

If you hold a preferred stock, basically, you know what you're going to be making in each particular period. Okay. The dividend is identified in advance. They're fixed at the time of issue and they don't change. So that's a lot like bonds in that case or a lot like other forms of debt in that case which have fixed interest payments. Okay. So the dividend payment is fixed at the time of issue for preferred stock. That being said, then the lender who's focused on the security of repayment generally sees preferred shares as a form of equity. Okay. And this is because they get paid out before the preferred stock shareholders and the common shareholder. On the other hand, the people who hold common stock, who are generally focused on the growth in company value C preferred shares as a form of debt. Okay. And that's because a fixed dividend is paid. Okay. And because of that reason, the lender and the common shareholder tend to have these different views of preferred stock. And this once again goes back to the fact that they are this hybrid instrument that do have some characteristics of debt and some characteristics of equity. The last point that I want to mention about preferred stock are summarized here on this slide Because preferred stocks are perpetual, it is important to note that many of them do have call features. Okay? And as we talked about when we considered Bond's call features, basically give the issuing firm the option to retire them should the need or advantage arise.

Some preferred stocks, it's important to note, do have. Mandatory sinking funds which allow the firm to retire the issue over time. And you may be wondering why firms would even bother to issue preferred shares, why they'd go to the trouble of creating this additional hybrid instrument. And some reasons for that are summarized here. But the main reason is that typically preferred shares are issued because a company is trying to maintain a good credit rating on their debt. Okay, So keep in mind from previous discussions that credit rating agencies generally assess the quality of risk associated with debt and of course, too high a level of debt, which is reflected in some of the ratios we talked about earlier on, specifically the debt ratio and the Times interest earned. So having a high debt ratio and a low times interest earned would tend to indicate too high. A level of debt leads to a lowered credit rating. So as your level of debt goes up, your credit rating often goes down. The market interest rate for bonds is directly linked to the credit rating, and preferred shares are therefore used by companies to raise near debt without lowering the credit rating of their bonds. Over the next several slides, we're going to talk a little bit about stock valuation. And I think this is a useful section because it helps us to understand the factors that influence stock price.

And remember, that's an important thing for all managers and engineers and engineering managers within a firm to understand, because ultimately the goal of the firm is to maximize shareholder wealth, which is reflected in the stock price. So we need to be aware of those broad factors that influence stock price. Stockholders expect to be compensated for their investment in a firm's shares through periodic dividends and capital gains. So remember, basically the two ways that a common stockholder can get a return on their investment is through the payment of dividends, which are at the discretion of the firm's board and capital gains which basically arise when they sell the stock for an amount more than they purchased it for. Okay. So with that in mind, then investors generally purchase shares when they feel they are undervalued and sell them when they believe they're overvalued. And of course, investors base their investment decisions on their perceptions of an asset's risk. So of course investors always take into account this relationship between risk and return. That's really one of the fundamental principles of any investment decision, whether it's for capital budgeting or for purchasing stocks or as a part of your your investment portfolio or individual investment portfolio. In competitive markets, the interaction of many buyers and sellers results basically in equilibrium price. This is what we call the market value for each security. And this price is said to be reflective of all information available to market participants in making buy or sell investment decisions.

Now, of course, perceptions change over time, and so we need to think about how the market adjusts to new information and basically the process of market adjustment to new information can be viewed once again in terms of rates of return. So we always tend to frame our our discussions in terms of rates of return and risk when we're talking about these types of things. When investors find that the expected price is not equal to the required return, of course a price adjustment will occur. And when we talk about expected return and required return, it is important to make a distinction between them and make sure that you do understand the difference between them. Required return is basically what an investor has to have to invest in a specific asset. Expected return is the return an investor thinks he or she will get if the asset is purchased. Okay, so note the distinction between those. If the expected return is greater than the required return, investors will buy and bid up the price until the new equilibrium price is reached. And of course the opposite would occur if the required return is greater than the expected return. With that in mind, then the next several slides actually introduce some some stock valuation models and we'll start by looking at common stock valuation and then we'll talk a little bit about preferred stock preferred stock valuation as well. When we're looking at common stock valuation, remember, we need to take into account both dividends and growth.

Okay? Remember basically the two ways that a stock earns value for investors, or at least a common stock earns value is the payment of dividends and growth over time. Okay. So if you sell the if you if you sell the stock for a value higher than its original purchase, price growth over time has occurred. And if you actually sell that stock, you would then earn a capital gain. So stock returns with that in mind are derived from both dividends and capital gains, and the expected return may be expressed, as noted here on the screen. Okay. So the expected return is basically equal to the dividend divided by the stock price plus the growth rate. And a very basic example helps illustrate that if a firm's $1 dividend on a $25 stock is expected to grow at 7%, the expected return in this case is going to be equal to 11%. And that's found, of course, just by directly plugging in to the formula given on the screen here. The basic stock valuation equation is represented here. And this is, again, once again building on the time value of money equations that we've looked at earlier on in the course, very similar approach to bond valuation that we looked at in the previous lecture in that we're looking basically for the present value of future cash flows. In this case, then again, we're using the value of those future cash flows in the compound.

Interest models in this in this valuation model. You can see here that this model basically ignores growth in stock value since we're assumed to hold on to it. And and the other reason that it's not taken into account here is, of course, if you sell the stock, then you're basically giving up the right to future dividends. So the basic stock valuation model here tends to focus, of course, more on dividends, and that's something that you can see just by looking at the formula value here, p, p o here or P zero. The value of common stock is a term that you're going to see in many of the upcoming upcoming formulas. The zero growth model is another model that we need to take into account. This is basically the simplest approach to dividend valuation and it assumes that the stock will pay the same dividend each year, year after year. And the key formula in this case is P0, which once again is equal to the value of the common stock divided by the dividend or equal equal to pardon me, the dividend divided by the required return. Okay. And you can see the application of this formula in a couple of very basic examples over the next slides. Okay. So in this case, what would an investor be willing to pay for a stock if she expected to receive a dividend of $2.50 each year indefinitely and her required return is 15%? We could simply use the formula that we looked at in the previous slide.

You take the $2.50, you divide that by 15% and you can find the value of the stock in this case would be equal to about $16.67. You can see that this example basically involves a simple manipulation of the zero growth equation. So you can solve for a different variable depending on the information that you're given. Of course, what would an investors required return be if the stock price is $119? And if she expected the firm to pay a dividend of $4 per year. Once again here you can basically plug into the formula for the zero growth dividend model, slight rearranging in this particular case, and you can solve for that to be equal to 3.3, 6% would be our expected rate of return. So that was the zero growth model. And once again, the zero growth model is probably the simplest model for the valuation of dividends. We also have the constant, the constant dividend growth model, which recognizes that dividends may grow at a constant rate each year, year after year. Okay. And you can see the derivation of this formula on the screen here once again makes use of the fact that we need to take into account the value of all the future cash flows received in order to put together this formula. And as we saw earlier on, P0 once again represents the value of the common stock.

D is the value of the dividends. K is the required return on the common stock, and G in this case is growth. This is probably the most widely used dividend valuation approach. Again, it assumes the constant growth of dividends. And note in this case that if we set g equal to zero, in other words, the growth equal to zero, then we would just have the zero growth formula. Okay, so you can use this formula very easily for both the zero growth and the constant growth of dividends. Couple simple examples with this particular formula are presented over the next couple of slides. Just give you a little practice on how to put this formula into practice. Into practice. What would an investor be willing to pay for a stock if she just received a dividend of $2.50, her required return is 15% and she expects dividends to grow at a rate of 5% per year. You can see here that once again, we just plug directly into the formula after we figured out what the dividend will be one year in the future. In this case, it comes out to be $2.63. We then take that value plugging in our dividend one year in advance, which once again is represented here in this bottom formula. Okay, that's what that D one value is. Okay. So we calculate D one first of all, and then we simply plug into the formula. Okay. Straight, straight ahead, basically a direct plug and chug type formula.

And you can see we calculate the values as represented here on the screen. Basically, we have the same type of thing. In this next example here we have a very basic manipulation of the formula. What required return would an investor receive if she paid $26.30 for a share of stock that paid $2.50 dividend that increased at a 5% rate each year? Once again, you have to start by calculating this value for D one exactly as we did in the in the previous example. And then you rearrange the formula in order to solve as is done on the left hand side of the screen directly plug all that in and you can get the numbers as represented here. It's important to note that the zero and constant growth models do not allow for any shift in expected growth rates. If you are interested in learning more about this variable growth model, you can do so by consulting the textbook. Basically the non constant dividend growth or the variable growth model, as it's often called, assumes that the stock will pay dividends that grow at one rate during one period and that at another rate in another year or thereafter. Okay. So basically you have changing rates of dividend growth. And again, you can consult the textbook if you are interested in that. It does go a little bit beyond the scope and a little bit what I think you need to know for the purposes of this course.

But I should note that the concern over all possible shifts in growth is probably unlikely to yield much more accuracy than a simpler model. And note that because the estimates produced can't really be very precise, given that the forecasts of future growth and discount rates are themselves necessarily approximate. This model isn't used as often in practice as the constant growth dividend model that we looked at earlier on. The free cash flow model is another model that you may come across. And I just want to spend a moment on that. So you're familiar with it. This approach is particularly useful when you're looking to value a firm that has no dividend history or a firm that's a start up, or when one is valuing an evaluating a valuing, pardon me, an operating unit or division of a larger public company, we would tend to use this approach. Okay, so this is most useful when we don't have dividend history. Of course, all those other other models, we did need dividend history in order to put things together. And the free cash flow model then is based on the same premise as the dividend valuation models, except that we value the firm's free cash flows rather than dividends. Okay. So once again, basically we're taking the value of all the future cash flows. In this case, we're looking at free cash flow rather than dividends and then trying to assign a present value to that.

So once again, we're building on our knowledge of the time value of money. Taking that into account, then you can see that the free cash valuation model estimates the value of the entire company and uses the cost of capital as the discount rate. As a result, the value of the firm's debt and preferred stock must be subtracted from the value of the company to estimate the value of equity. So the common stock value, which is represented as VZ, would therefore be equal to the value of the entire company or the company value v, c minus v, d, which is the market value of all the firm's debt minus vrp, which is the value of preferred stock. Other approaches to stock valuation? Well, there are many of them out there. Just to summarize a couple of them, just to make sure that you have, once again, just a passing familiarity with these and are aware that they exist include book value, liquidation, value and P multiples. The book value method basically is based on historical balance sheet data. So book value per share is essentially the amount per share that would be received if all the firm's assets were sold for their exact book value. And then if the proceeds remaining after paying all the liabilities were divided amongst the common stockholders. As we know, this method does lack some sophistication because it does rely on historical balance sheet data. And remember that the balance sheet data can be distorted due to inflation.

Balance sheet data doesn't necessarily represent market values, and that's something we talked about when we looked at the balance sheet. And the other thing that it does is it ignores the firm's earnings potential. Okay. So that's another significant weakness of the book value method to stock valuation. Liquidation value is a little bit more realistic because it does take into account the current market values of the firm's assets. The liquidation value per share With that in mind is the actual amount per share of common stock to be received. If all the firm's assets were sold for their market values, liabilities were paid and any remaining funds were divided among common stockholders. It's a little bit more realistic than book value because it's based on current market values of the firm's assets. But once again, it does fail to consider the earning power of those assets. And it may be based a little bit on speculation when you're trying to figure out what the market values of those assets may be. The among the other approaches, probably the best method is the P multiple method because it does consider the expected earnings. So it does take into account the earning power of the interest. It's also a particularly useful tool for valuing firms that aren't publicly traded. So in this case, you can look at, you know, the formula as as depicted here on the screen. But as you are applying this, if you actually do apply this in practice, just keep in mind that the price earnings multiple method does have have a few weaknesses, including determining the appropriate PE ratio.

Potentially you could use an industry average ratio to compare it to determining the appropriate definition of earnings. Again, it could be subject to some debate and determining the estimated future earnings. Of course, forecasting future earnings is extremely difficult. And just a general comment, the value of stock is a pretty tricky proposition. In general, using any of these methods is a bit tricky because it will depend on the assumptions made and the techniques used. I did provide an example in your course package. I just want to very briefly highlight it here. I'm not going to go through this in any level of detail, but it is useful for learning how to apply some of the formulas that we looked at in today's lecture. So you can spend some time going over this on your own time. I'm not going to go through the solution. A great level of detail here. One thing that I did want to note is you can see here the first thing you had to calculate was the growth rate of the dividends in order to plug into your constant growth dividend model, you can figure out the growth rate using the method here, which is one method by hand, or you can do it using the rate formula in Excel. Okay. Recall when we talked about the time value of money, we talked about that you can use that formula rate in Excel, so you can use the rate formula to figure out the growth here.

And in fact, that might be a useful exercise for you to do to make sure that you get a comparable answer to the one displayed here in the example. So summarizing some of the key points that we've spent talking about over the last couple of lectures in terms of changes in value of stocks and bonds, if a stock or a bond increases in value, the issuer does not see that increase, only the owner. Okay. So remember, when a corporation issues a stock or bond, they collect a certain amount of money. The value of that stock and bond is going to fluctuate in response to changes in market rates. Okay, but the issuer of the bond or the stock doesn't see that increase. They've already collected their cash. Okay. It's the it's the person who holds the stock or holds the bond that sees those increases or decreases. Okay. So keep that in mind. Once the issuer has collected their money, then it's out of their hands. Okay. It's they don't see any of the increases or decreases. It's the person who actually owns the stock or owns the bond at that point that is affected by changes in the market interest rates. The market value of bonds is driven by interest rate changes, as we discussed in the previous lecture, following interest following interest increases the value of bonds.

And we also talked about the fact today that stock values are changed by interest rates, profitability and growth prospects. And really that's the key point that I want you to take out of today's lecture, that stock values are changed by these factors. Once again, it's the broad factors in terms of the value of stocks that I'd like you to be aware of. Of course, there are many models. Associated with stock valuation. And there's there's many more out there. We didn't cover them in any level of detail. The key was really to emphasize the fact that stocks are emphasized by growth prospects and by dividend payments and of course, changing interest rates. Okay. So these are the key things that we need to take into into into account. Of course, stock value is very complex and there's many different ways of looking at this. But again, the key things that we need to keep in mind are dividends basically, and growth prospects when we're trying to figure out the value of any any stocks. So that concludes our discussion of stocks for today's lecture. Once again, keep in mind that the most important things that I'd like you to retain from this lecture are those broad factors that influence the the value of a stock, because once again, these are very closely tied to the goal of the firm. And because of that, all engineering managers within the firm need to be aware of those factors.",7773,"[-0.01400004  0.00036594  0.01191106 ... -0.00523866 -0.00193652

Captial Structure,9.0,CEFA,"Title: Captial Structure; Description: In this video lecture on capital structure and its impact on financial performance, the key takeaways can be summarized as follows. The main goal of choosing the optimal capital structure is to minimize the cost of capital and maximize the value of the firm. Firms possess a target capital structure that minimizes their capital costs, but there is no specific methodology to determine the optimal structure. Debt financing provides a tax shield through deductibility of interest payments, reducing corporate taxes and increasing cash flows. However, there are costs and cautions associated with debt financing, such as an increased probability of bankruptcy, agency costs, and asymmetric information between managers and investors. Business risk and financial risk influence the probability of bankruptcy, with higher risks increasing it and lower risks decreasing it. The agency problem refers to the potential conflict of interest between owners, managers, and lenders, which can be mitigated through monitoring techniques and agency costs. Asymmetric information can lead to actions that signal positive or negative prospects to investors, affecting the perception and value of the firm. The market value of a company is maximized when the cost of capital is minimized. The EPS EBIT approach focuses solely on maximizing earnings per share and ignores factors such as risk and the timing of cash flows. The preferred capital structure should be based on the highest estimated share value, considering both risk and return. Different factors such as tax benefits, business risk, agency costs, management preferences, risk aversion, asymmetric information, external risk assessment, and timing need to be considered when choosing the optimal capital structure. The example provided illustrates the principles discussed, analyzing different capital structures and their impact on return on equity and risk. The difficulty of determining an appropriate times interest earned without comparative data is acknowledged. The EBIT-EPS graph and zero growth valuation model are introduced as tools for analyzing the relationship between EBIT and EPS and determining the capital structure that maximizes shareholder value. Balancing the benefits and costs of debt financing is crucial when determining the optimal capital structure.; Transcript: Greetings. In this lecture, we'll be discussing key considerations associated with a firm's capital structure. We're going to begin by discussing capital structure theory to help provide some context for choosing the optimal capital structure. And in between, we're also going to spend a few minutes talking a little bit about the Ebit, EPS approach to capital structure, which is one of the more common approaches for using the capital or determining the optimal capital structure. It's generally believed that the value of the firm is maximized when the cost of capital is minimized. And this is a point that's really going to form the basis for choosing the optimal capital structure. And it sure seems to make intuitive sense because naturally we want to pay as little as possible for the money that we use to create value by way of introduction. Then capital structure is one of the most common area or complex areas of financial decision making due to its interrelationship with other financial decision variables. As you'll see when we get into this, one of the reasons that capital structure is so complex is that it really links together many of the other concepts that we've covered throughout the course. So in order to understand the firm's capital structure, you need to understand things associated with the time value of money, with stocks and bonds in terms of calculating the cost of capital and also the principle of leverage. So there's all kinds of things that go into the discussions associated with a firm's capital structure.

One of the reasons that we pay so close attention to this is that poor capital structure decisions can result in high cost of capital, thereby lowering project npvs and making them more unacceptable. And on the other side of the coin, looking at it from a more positive point of view, one of the reasons we need to pay attention to capital structure is because effective decisions associated with determining capital structure can lower the cost of capital, resulting in higher npvs and more acceptable projects, thereby increasing the value of the firm, which is, of course, the goal of any manager or engineer in the firm to ultimately increase shareholder wealth and capital structure is one of the key things in making that happen. As a bit of a refresher, when we're talking about capital structure, of course we need to recognize that there are two forms of capital. Basically, there's debt and equity associated with debt. We have long term debt. And within the equity classification, of course, we have preferred stock, common stock, which in turn includes common stock equity and retained earnings. So information on these types of capital, of course, is found on the balance sheet. We've talked about this quite a bit throughout the course already, so I don't want to spend any more time on that. But of course, whenever you're talking about capital structure, it's absolutely critical to recognize that you have these two forms of capital, you have debt and you have equity, and you should understand the different types of equity that do make up that particular classification.

So getting into capital structure theory, then, according to finance theory, firms do possess a target capital structure that will minimize its capital costs. And once again, this is, I think, fairly intuitive and sure seems to be true. However, it is important to note that the theory cannot yet provide financial managers with a specific methodology to help them determine what their firm's optimal, optimal capital structure might be. So we have a theory, but it's important to note that no one is really sure how to put it into practice all of the time. Okay. And one of the reasons for this is that different capital structures are appropriate for different businesses. What is clear, however, is that a firm's optimal capital structure will balance the benefits of debt financing against its costs. Of course, the benefits of debt financing is something that we discussed at length in the lecture on the cost of capital. The major benefit of debt, of course, of debt financing is the tax shield provided by the federal Government. Regarding interest payments, of course, allowing companies to deduct interest payments when computing taxable income essentially lowers the amount of corporate taxes that a company has to pay. This, in turn, of course, increases the firm's cash flows. Okay. Every dollar of cash that you don't have to pay for taxes is something that you can use to create additional value and therefore makes more cash available to investors.

With that in mind, then in essence, the government is essentially subsidizing the cost of debt financing relative to equity financing. So we spent quite a bit of time talking about that. And once again, that's the major benefit of using debt financing. It's tax deductible. Okay. So insurance payments associated with debt are tax deductible. Dividend payments associated with equity are not tax deductible. And as we saw in our discussion on the cost of capital, for that reason, debt is always cheaper than equity. So that's one thing that we need to consider when we're setting up capital structure. Remember, of course, we're looking to balance the benefits versus the costs. And for that reason, we need to consider the main cost of debt financing. Generally speaking, the result from three key things. One is the increased probability of bankruptcy caused by debt obligations. The second is that agency costs resulting from lenders monitoring the firm's actions can also be looked at as a negative associated with debt financing. And the third is that the costs associated with the firm's managers having there are costs associated with the firm's manager having more information about the firm's prospects than investors. And this is what we call asymmetric information. Now, since we spent so much time talking about the benefits. Of of using debt financing. And once again, the main benefit, of course, is that it is tax deductible.

I did want to spend a few minutes taking a closer look at the costs and cautions associated with debt financing. If nothing else, it helps to explain why businesses are not 100% debt financed. The first that we need to look at is the probability of bankruptcy. The probability that debt obligations will lead to bankruptcy, of course, depends on the level of a company's business and financial risk. We've talked a little bit about business risk and financial risk earlier on in the course, but it's important to to reconsider them in this context associated with the probability of bankruptcy. Essentially, business risk is the risk of the firm being unable to cover operating costs. Of course, in general, the higher the firm's fixed costs relative to variable costs, the greater the firm's operating leverage and therefore the greatest, the greater its business risk. And that's something that we saw in our lecture on leverage. Business risk, of course, is also affected by revenue and costs of stability. And keeping those points in mind then is important to note that business risk is not directly affected by capital structure decisions, but firms will consider it in the establishment of their capital structure. Okay, so business risk is associated with the day to day running of the business. It's associated essentially with the operating of the business. It's not associated essentially with financial risks. Okay. Debt and equity considerations, which we're going to be looking at from the capital structure perspective, are therefore not directly associated with business risk.

Okay. That being said, although business risk does not explicitly consider is not explicitly considered in establishing a firm's capital structure, it must be implicitly considered. Okay. So in other words, you have to implicitly consider business risk when setting up your firm's capital structure. Generally speaking, the higher a firm's business risk, the more cautious the firm must be in establishing its capital structure. Therefore, firms that have high business risk tend towards less highly leveraged capital structures, and firms with low business risk tend towards more highly leveraged capital structures. Okay, So when we're looking at this notion of capital structure from the perspective of business and financial risk. Yes, business risk is not something that's explicitly considered, but it is implicitly built in to these considerations. On the other hand, of course, given that financial risk is the risk that a firm will not be able to cover its financial obligations, we need to look at we need to consider the fact that the firm's capital structure must directly consider this particular risk. Okay. Remember, debt and equity is associated with the financing of the business that's associated with financial considerations and therefore the firm's capital structure. The mix between debt and equity will directly impact financial leverage and must be directly taken into consideration. Of course, when we're setting up the firm's capital structure. We know that financial leverage measures the extent to which a firm employs fixed cost financing sources such as debt and preferred stock.

And of course, the greater the firm's financial leverage, the greater its financial risk and therefore the risk of being unable to meet its fixed interest. And preferred stock dividends. Okay, so in other words, higher business risks and higher financial risks are associated with increased probability of bankruptcy. And the opposite is also true. Lower business risks and lower financial risks tend to mean that you have a lower probability of bankruptcy. The total risk of the firm determines the probability of bankruptcy, and it takes into account both the business and the financial risks. The second caution associated with debt that we need to consider is this notion of agency costs imposed by lenders. Recall towards the beginning of the course, we talked a little bit about the agency problem and we talked about the fact that it applies to the relationship between owners and managers in that managers may sometimes act in their own interests rather than those of the shareholders. And of course, shareholders are the owners of a corporation. However, it's important to note that while the agency problem does extend to that relationship between owners and managers, it also extends to the relationships between owners and lenders. And once again, basically refers to the fact that owners may use information that benefits them rather than that of the lenders. Okay, So because of that interest rates, we need to consider a few basic points.

The first is that interest rates incurred by the firm are based on the lender's assessment of the risk of the firm's investments. Okay. So whenever a firm comes to a lender and the lender perceives that the investment that the the the firm looking to borrow the money is proposing is associated with a high risk. Okay. They would therefore require a higher return. Okay. So remember, for higher risk, lenders tend to demand higher levels of return. However, it's important to note that after obtaining the loan, the firm's stockholders and or its managers theoretically could use the funds to invest in riskier assets. Okay, so you could go make a proposal and then go around and re and invest the money that you've borrowed in a riskier a riskier investment than you were discussing with the lender. Okay. The problem with this, of course, is that the lender bases their the interest rates that they charge. On the perceived level of risk of the investments that you you bring to them. So if you invest in a higher a higher risk investment that hasn't been reflected in the interest rate that the lender has set. Okay. So if these high risk investments pay off, the stockholders benefit, but the firm's bondholders are the people who lent the money to the firm, are locked in and are unable to share in this success because the interest rate is fixed at the time of issue, at the time that they've lent the money.

Okay. So once once the money is lent, the lender doesn't necessarily know where it's going. And for this reason, clearly there's an incentive for managers acting on behalf of the stockholders to take advantage of the lenders and to avoid this. What lenders do is they basically impose certain monitoring techniques on the borrowers, and as a result, they're incurring agency costs. Okay. So these agency costs could include things like agency costs are associated with the examples here. Okay. So monitoring costs is one illustration of an agency cost, and that could be reflected through things such as the lender raising the rate on future debt issues. They could, for instance, deny future loan issues or they could impose restrictive loan provisions. And often, of course, when firms do borrow money, it is for a specific purpose. But and that would be reflected in the restrictive loan provision. The last caution of using debt that we need to consider is this notion of asymmetric information. And this basically results when managers of a firm have more information about operations and future prospects than do investors. And I think this is best demonstrated through an example. Okay. So we'll look at an example from two perspectives. And the first is that we're going to assume that management has identified an extremely lucrative investment opportunity it needs to raise capital. Okay. So management has identified this, this great investment. But in order to fund the investment, they need to raise some some money.

So based on this opportunity, management believes its stock is undervalued since the investors have no information about the investment. Okay, So management has identified this great opportunity, but no one else yet knows about it. Okay, so they've got this great opportunity. No one else knows about it. And because of that, that great opportunity is not reflected in the current stock price. Okay. So because of that, management thinks that the current stock price is actually undervalued because the investors don't have any information pertaining to this new great investment that's going to increase the shareholder wealth. In this case. Therefore, taking all this information into account, management is likely to raise funds using debt since they believe the stock is undervalued given this information. Okay. So if we think that the stock is undervalued, it would therefore make sense to raise the money using debt rather than issuing equity. Because if you're issuing equity, you're not going to be gaining the full value of that of that stock, as is the theory. So in this case, then the use of the debt is viewed as a positive signal to investors regarding the firm's prospects. Okay. So maybe stated another way then. Using debt is frequently viewed as a signal that reflects management's view of the firm's stock value. Okay. Debt financing is often viewed as a positive signal, suggesting that management believes that the stock is undervalued and therefore a bargain.

And therefore, when the firm's positive future outlook becomes known to the market, the increased future value will be fully captured by the existing owners rather than having to be shared with new shareholders. Okay. Now you can also look at this from a completely opposite situation. Okay? So we can look at it from the perspective of having that great lucrative investment opportunity. Now we can look at it from the other perspective. In this case, if the outlook of the of the firm is poor, management will issue equity instead. Okay. Instead of raising debt because they believe that the price of the firm's stock is overvalued. Okay, so issuing equity is therefore generally thought of as a negative signal. Okay. So if the outlook for the firm is poor, management might believe the stock is overvalued and therefore in that case it would be in the best interest of the existing stockholders, which is, remember always who management is supposed to be acting, acting on in terms of their interest. So it would be best for the existing stockholders for the firm to issue new stock. Therefore, investors often interpret the announcement of a stock issue as a negative signal. And what this this notion of asymmetric information basically demonstrates is that we need to consider how the market will help, will interpret any of our actions. Of course, it is a bit of an inexact science, but it also demonstrates this notion, these cautions associated with using debt and how the market or how people outside of the company might perceive the acquisition of additional might perceive the acquisition of the additional debt on the part of the firm.

So keeping those cautions in mind, then we can return to the starting point of this section. And that is when we're looking at considerations associated with optimal capital structure. In general, it's believed that the market value of a company is maximized when the cost of capital is minimized. We have an equation in order to determine the market value. It's basically represented as the firm's net operating profit after taxes divided by the weighted average cost of capital. So we need to take into account the weighted average cost of capital, which we calculated in an earlier lecture. When we looked at all those considerations associated with the cost of capital. And of course, we need to know how to calculate the net operating profit after taxes, which is basically the Ebit multiplied by one minus I one minus the tax rate. And once again, that's something that we've talked about many times throughout the lecture. For example, when we first introduced the income statement, we talked a little bit about those types of considerations. Now this this equation for market value is demonstrated graphically on the next slide. And basically what this helps demonstrate once again is that the maximum market value occurs at the point where the weighted average cost of capital is minimized.

So if you take a look at this figure, you'll see that the highest point for the the value, which is that top curve occurs at the point where the weighted average cost of capital is minimized. Of course, the weighted average cost of capital takes into account the cost of equity and the cost of debt and the relative levels of of equity and debt in the firm's capital structure. You can see that the weighted average cost of capital is going to be highest, of course, when it is funded, when the business is funded completely with equity. And the reason for that, of course, is that equity is always going to be more expensive than debt because debt interest payments associated with debt are tax deductible. So remember, because debt is tax deductible, interest payments associated with debt are tax deductible. It's going to be lower than equity in terms of cost. So if you look at the weighted average cost of capital curve on this figure, you can see that the weighted average cost of capital comes down as you add more and more debt. Okay. And then finally, we get to that point where it is at its lowest. And at that point, once again, the market value of the firm is going to be maximized because it directly takes into account the weighted average cost of capital. But then there comes a point when the cost of debt begins to rise. And the reason this happens, of course, is that as you borrow more and more debt, the price of that debt goes up because the lenders perceive the firm, to perceive the firm to be assuming greater risk because now they have these higher interest payments that they need to make.

And of course, we know that the cost of debt is fixed so they have a higher hurdle essentially that they have to jump over before they can actually be profitable. Okay. So there comes a point when the cost of debt begins, begins to rise, and the weighted average cost of capital also begins to go up as well. Now, one of the popular approaches for determining the optimal capital, optimal capital structure is the Ebit. Eps approach. It's also called the EPS Ebit approach. So either way is perfectly fine, the approach to capital structure. Basically, this approach involves selecting the capital structure that maximizes the firm's earnings per share over the expected range of Ebit, over the expected range of earnings before interest and taxes. Coordinates for the Ebit EPS graph can be found by assuming specific Ebit values and then essentially calculating the EPS associated with them. Under this approach, the emphasis is on maximizing the owner's returns. So in other words, this approach is focused on maximizing the earnings per share. That being said, then it should be clear that a major shortcoming of this approach is the fact that earnings are only one of the determinants of the shareholder wealth maximization.

So recall earlier on in the course we talked about the fact that the goal of the firm is not necessarily to maximize profit. On the other hand, the goal of the firm is to maximize shareholder wealth. Okay. So and the reason for this is the focus on earnings or the focus on earnings per share in this particular case ignores risk. Okay. It also ignores the timing of cash flows and maximizing shareholder wealth. That goal does explicitly take into account risk and does explicitly take into cash flow, take into account the timing of cash flows. Okay. So although the EPS Ebit approach is relatively commonly used to determine the firm's optimal optimal capital structure, it is important to note that it does suffer from this very large risk in that it does not explicitly consider the impact of risk. Okay. So because of that, it does have a it does have that pretty big weakness attached to it. And we need to keep in mind that the overall goal of the firm, of course, is to maximize shareholder wealth. I am going to provide a very brief example of the EPS Ebit approach to capital structure later on in the lecture. So I'll just very briefly show you how you can put together that type of figure if you are interested in seeing how that can be done. So in terms of choosing the optimal capital structure, then any wealth maximization framework for use in making these decisions should include, of course, the two key factors of risk and return.

And remember, these are always the key factors that we need to take into account in any of the decisions we make associated with the the firm. We need to take into account the various levels of risk of any particular investment, and we need to take into account what returns are going to arise from us assuming those particular risks. Therefore, the preferred capital structure is one that results in the highest estimated share value, not necessarily the earnings per share. Okay. So I'm not saying that there's not any relationship between profit and value, but that it's not necessarily always going to be as direct as as we would as we might think initially for many of the reasons that we've discussed throughout the course. Of course, the main ones being that profit or earnings doesn't take into account the timing of cash flows and it doesn't explicitly consider risk. However, if we use the formula on the bottom of the screen here, we can see that we can very explicitly take into account risk. So if we assume that the firm's share value can be calculated as the earnings per share divided by the required return, we can get a more reasonable representation of the firm's share value than we might using an approach such as the EPS Ebit approach to capital structure. Of course, the required return, which is represented by CSS here, does explicitly consider risk.

So whenever an investor or a lender sets a required return, of course they take into account risk. And for that reason, this formula on the screen here does very explicitly take into account risk. And this is a formula that we're going to apply in the example in a few moments at the end of the lecture. But before we do that, it is important to note that we need to take into account, of course, intuitive and strategic factors when we are choosing the firms optimal capital structure. So that formula on the previous screen, yes, it's very useful. But in addition to quantitative factors, a firm will often need to consider a whole bunch of other things when they're making capital structure decisions. Some of those have been summarized here, and they're grouped into three basic classifications that are directly associated with those cautions that we were looking at earlier on associated with debt. So of course, we we need to consider the benefits associated with debt financing. That's the mainly the tax deductibility. And that, of course tends to lower the weighted average cost of capital as you use more debt within a within certain limits, of course. But we also need to consider these cautions. So we look at that benefit, okay, the tax benefit and we need to look at the cautions. So things associated with business risk, for instance, revenue stability and cash flow, basically the higher revenue stability and the higher the cash flow, the more likely you'll be able to have high leverage.

Okay. Higher revenue stability and cash flow basically equate with lower business risk. If you have lower business risk, you therefore can tend towards higher financial leverage. Agency costs could include things like contractual obligations, various contracts could impose, could impose constraints on the firm and on the managers and engineers of that firm. Management preferences, of course, is something we need to take into account, could have internal constraints. Risk aversion, of course, is a general thing that most managers will exhibit control. Okay. Managers may be concerned with things like a hostile takeover and for that reason don't want to issue too much equity. Asymmetric information also has its own considerations. External risk assessment that's going to be conducted by bond raters, for instance. And timing. Of course, we need to consider the situation at that particular time, whether it makes most sense to issue debt or equity, which ultimately, of course will have an impact on the firm's capital structure. To help bring together many of the principles that we've been discussing throughout this lecture. I wanted to go through this this illustrative example. And again, it's a fairly comprehensive example. I think that once again demonstrates most of the key principles you need to retain from this lecture. In this case, we have a company that's a producer, a printer equipment, expects expects flat sales for the next 3 to 5 years, with the Ebit expected to remain at 1.2 million per year.

So we're expecting that our Ebit is going to be 1.2 million per year over the next several years. Given that we're not expecting our Ebit to increase, the CFO or the chief financial officer wants to find new ways to operate more efficiently. And one of the ways that they're going to do this is to analyze the firm's capital structure to determine whether or not the firm has adequate leverage. And of course, as we learned in our lecture on leverage, leverage can have a very real impact on the returns, on the return on equity earned by a firm. But of course, it's also going to have a very real impact on the risk associated with that particular firm. So the first thing that we're asked to do is calculate the times interest earned for each of the capital structure listed below. And then to evaluate, you can see that basically we have a current situation and we have two alternatives that are under consideration. The current situation. Under the current situation, we have a 10% level of debt. Okay? So the 10% level of debt in this case equates to a debt of $1 million. Alternatively, we have a 30% level of debt and alternative B, we have a 50% level of debt for total debt values of $3 Million and $5 Million respectively. Okay. So we can assume all this information is given.

Okay. So we are told that we have this current situation and then we have these two alternatives that we're considering where the debts or the debt ratio goes up to 30 and 50% respectively. We're told that the coupon rate for the interest rates associated with these various levels of debt are 9%, 10% and 12%. Of course, as we would expect, these rates go up as the level of debt goes up once again to compensate lenders for the increased risk associated with the fact that more debt would be issued. Therefore, the dollar value of the interest can be calculated by simply taking the coupon rate multiplied by the debt. Okay, so 9% multiplied by 1,090,000. And similarly, you can calculate the interest to be 300 and 600,000 respectively for alternatives A and alternatives B, we know that the Ebit is going to be steady at 1.2 million. Okay. So we're told that the Ebit is going to be steady. It doesn't matter what alternative we use. The earnings before interest and taxes is going to be about 1.2 million. That's the assumption that we're making because once again, we're assuming a flat level of Ebit at 1.2 million per year. With that in mind, then we can calculate the times interest earned, as was asked in this particular part of the question and from our discussion of racial analysis earlier on in the course, you'll know that the Times interest earned is the Ebit or the earnings before interest and taxes divided by the interest.

You can see that it goes from a high of 13.33 to a low of 2.0. So the current situation, of course, Ebit is going to be very high because we have very low levels of interest to pay. And in alternatives A and B, it's going to decrease quite a bit because now we have higher interest payments that we need to be making. Okay. So the key question really is what is the appropriate times interest earned? The first situation, maybe it's relatively excessive. The last situation, I don't know. Maybe it's a little low. It's, of course, tough to know in the absence of comparative data. Okay. And when we're unable to compare two similar businesses operating in the printer equipment industry, which is the industry this particular company is operating under, in Part B, we're asked to prepare an Ebit EPS graph showing the current and two alternative capital structures. Okay. So basically what we have is we have that current situation. Okay? So you can see that we have that situation where the Ebit is 1.2 million for each of the three alternatives. Okay. So the current alternative A and alternative B all have Ebit of 1.2 million. And then basically what we need are some other other points. Okay. So we need some other points in order to put the graph together. The one that I selected here is 600,000 and zero. Okay, 600,000 was selected arbitrarily.

Okay. So you could have picked 500,000, for instance. It's it's really up to you. But basically what you do is you calculate all all those values. You use those values. Pardon me to calculate your earnings earnings per share. Okay. Because what we need in order to plot an Ebit EPS graph, of course, is EPS and Ebit values. Okay. So we take the information where we know our our Ebit. Okay. We know our interest rate, we know our profit before taxes. We know our profit after taxes. We can see that we have a certain number of shares. And all that information we can assume is given in terms of the number of shares. So the current situation, we had 100. Thousand chairs. Alternatively, we had 70,000 shares. Alternative B, we had 40,000 shares. And you can see that the earnings per share in this case will vary quite a bit depending on on the level of Ebit. Each of these alternatives has basically what you do is you then take those values and you can plot them. So you put you take a look at what's your your EPS for a certain value, take a look at what your Ebit is for that that EPS, you plot it and you can very quickly put together a graph on EPS and Ebit. Keeping in mind, of course, that you need to have enough, you need to have at least an absolute minimum of two points in order to put this graph together.

So you have to arbitrarily select an intermediate point in order to put this graph together, as was done on the previous slide. Third question that we're asked for a given Ebit, which capital structure will maximize Tampa's earnings per share? And why might this not be the best capital structure? Well, if if the company's Ebit is 1.2 million, the earnings per share is highest with the 50% debt levels. So if we go back to our table here, you see that if our Ebit is 1.2 million, okay, as is the case in these columns, the EPS is highest for alternative B with the 50% level, you can say the earnings per share is $9 for that particular situation, which is higher than any of the other situations under consideration. However, one of the reasons why this might not be the best capital structure is that the it has a much higher level of debt than the current situation, and therefore the risk is going to be higher. Okay. We have to take into account the fact that our financial leverage increases as debt ratio increases. And therefore, although we might have a higher earnings per share, we're also assuming a much higher level of risk. Okay. Remember, this company is expecting flat sales, Okay? And now all of a sudden we've introduced this much, much higher level of interest payments that they have to make. So they better hope that things don't go negatively.

Otherwise they may not be able to make the interest payments. Okay. So that's using the Ebit, EPS approach. Any way you would see that the EPS is highest with the 50% debt levels. But remember, the Ebit EPS approach does not explicitly take risk into consideration. To do that, we need to use the zero growth validation model. Okay. So we're using the zero growth validation model, which is essentially that market value formula is the market value is equal to the EPS divided by the required return. Cs Of course being the required return, EPS being the earnings per share, you can then figure out what the market value which, which alternative, pardon me, maximizes the market value. Okay. So in this case you can assume. Or given. Okay, so I gave you those to be 12, 13 and 18% respectively. Okay. So the current situation, you have your your EPS of $6.66. Again, that's just taken from this calculation here. Okay. You divide that by your required return, which was given as 12. And you do the exact same thing for alternatives A and B. So alternative A earnings per share was 771 for that 1.2 million. Alternative B we know it was $9 and you can very easily figure out the the value that maximizes the or the alternative pardon me that maximizes the share value. And in this case, you can see that that's alternative. A Okay. So although alternative B would have made the selection would have would have been the selection if we'd used the EPS Ebit approach.

If we use this market value approach, which takes into account risk very explicitly, then alternative A is actually the one that makes the most sense. Okay, so which capital structure would you recommend and why? Alternative A has 30% debt level appears to be the best option because it maximizes the share price, which once again is what we're trying to do in terms of the overall value of the firm. Now, I did prepare one additional example in your course package. It's called capital structure. And I'm not going to go through all of this in great detail. I just wanted to explain very briefly that the formula that was used here was the the constant growth valuation model. Okay? So the formula that was used was the constant growth valuation model, and that's something that we looked at earlier on in the earlier on in the course. And once you know that, I think that this calculations or these calculations, pardon me, are very straightforward. So I don't think it would add any additional value for me to go through this in any level of detail. So that brings to a close our discussion of capital structure. Once again, the value of the firm is assumed to be maximized when the weighted average cost of capital is minimized is really the key point in this lecture. But of course we have to balance the benefits associated with debt financing versus the costs.",7751,"[-1.37534123e-02 -1.58337597e-02  1.59493349e-02 ... -3.94028102e-05

Organizational Ethics,2.1,ACO,"Title: Organizational Ethics; Description: The key takeaways from this video transcript focus on the environmental context of organizations, with an emphasis on ethics, organizational design, and reward systems. The instructor highlights the importance of understanding and defining ethics, as well as its impact on organizational behavior and performance. They discuss the significance of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in relation to ethics in organizations and explore the role of organizational culture in influencing ethical behavior. The concept of rewards and recognition systems as incentives for employee performance is also examined, with an alternative view from researcher Alfie Cohn. The video addresses various ethical issues such as sexual harassment and employee privacy, and stresses the importance of considering the external environment and peer pressure when examining ethical decision-making. The negative impact of ethical scandals on trust in society is discussed, along with the need for more honesty and integrity in organizations and leadership. Overall, the video aims to provide students with a deeper understanding of ethics and its implications in complex organizations.; Transcript: Welcome back to our third session of ENMA 601 Analysis of Complex Organizations. Today we're going to wrap up our discussion of the environmental context in which our organizations tend to survive and thrive often. And we will talk about some very important topics ethics being one of the most important, the design of the organization and the impact that that's going to have on the behavior of the people, the performance of the people in the organization. And we're going to wrap this discussion up with a somewhat in depth discussion of reward systems, both the intrinsic and the extrinsic, the tangible and the intangible. And finally, I'll present to you an alternative view of the way that we engage in rewarding people in our environments today. And you can make the decision whether you agree with the alternate view or not. Ultimately, you're you're the one that has to make the decision about how well this information resonates with you. So without further ado, let's go ahead and begin. As I mentioned, this is our third module. We'll be finishing up our discussion of the environmental context. Quite a bit of information about ethics today. I want to give you some things to think about and things to ponder about ethics in the in the organization that you're in and the organizations that you lead. We'll talk a little bit about design and culture. And finally, reward systems. We'll wrap up our discussion today. What I'd like to achieve today is I'd like you to walk away from this lesson in the readings with understanding a meaning or a definition of ethics that works for you.",520,"[-0.010233   -0.02254     0.01790938 ... -0.02053122 -0.00050423

Personality and Attitude,4.0,ACO,"Title: Personality and Attitude; Description: In this video, the instructor explores the topics of personality and attitude and their impact on organizational behavior. The concepts of perception and attribution are introduced as important factors in understanding how individuals interpret and make sense of the world around them. The instructor emphasizes that no one sees the world exactly as it is and that we each attribute meaning to events based on our own interpretations. Sensation and perception are differentiated, with sensation referring to the interactions between individuals and their environment and perception involving the processes of interpreting and making sense of stimuli. Factors that influence perception, such as intensity, size, motion, novelty, familiarity, and words, are discussed. Additionally, the instructor delves into how contrast, figure-ground, and perceptual grouping influence our perceptions. The importance of context in understanding new information is highlighted. The video concludes with an example of how individuals' perceptions can be deceived, such as seeing different images in the same picture. Overall, the key takeaway is that perception can be distorted and it is crucial to be aware of this in order to make informed decisions. Additionally, the instructor discusses the pitfalls of first impressions, stereotyping, and the halo effect. The need to give individuals a second chance and not rely solely on superficial traits is emphasized. The concept of attribution is introduced, highlighting the importance of considering whether events are caused by external circumstances or internal factors. The video concludes with an encouragement for viewers to reflect on their own experiences and consider how they can react differently armed with this knowledge.; Transcript: Welcome to our fourth module for ENMA 601 Analysis of Complex organizations. Today we're going to be talking about a couple of topics that will relate to each of us and an understanding ourselves that will help us to understand others a little bit better. We're going to be talking about personality and attitude and the impact that each has on organizational behavior and and helping us to analyze the behavior of that organization. It's a topic we need to be very familiar with. So the things we're going to talk about today have had a lot of research basis behind them. And in fact, the research into personality type is some of the most wide ranging and oldest research that's ever been conducted related to human emotions and human psychology. So without further ado, let's go ahead and bark on our journey through these two subjects today, personality and attitude. This is our fourth session. Our fourth module. And we will be trying today to give you a very good overview. Of both the concepts of perception as well as attribution. Now, if you want to become an expert at this and you can. It will require some additional study. But I think we'll give you enough tools to give you an overall sense of what the meaning of personality is, how you might employ. Personality to understand yourself a little bit better and to understand others. We're going to talk about things like the the Myers-Briggs type indicator and the Big five personality traits.

Both are very heavily researched and experientially based based in their theories. We'll talk about attitudes, emotional information, behavioral components of attitudes, and we'll talk a little bit about how that affects job performance, organizational commitment and some behaviors that are seen to be positive. We'll talk in more detail about the positive nature of organizational behavior In Session six. So let's begin by talking about perception and attribution. These are very important topics. It is important for each of us to realize that no one sees the world exactly as it is. There is no sense that any of us has a monopoly on objective truth. We each see things through the lens of our perceptions, through the lens of how we attribute things. When we talk about an attribution, what we're really talking about is when something happens, how do we ascribe meaning to it? When when an event occurs? One of the things that humans tend to do is to look for the meaning behind it. Was I. The cause of this problem? Was was the cause random? There's a tremendous amount of randomness in the universe, in the universe, and it impacts all of us on a fairly regular basis. Sometimes we ascribe those random events to something we did. If you look back on the history of humans, you'll see that there's a long history of worshipping gods of the rain and gods of the wheat and gods of the tomato crop.

And if you do certain things, you sacrifice a virgin over a volcano, then the gods will bring rain. And obviously they did that once and it happened. So the their perception, they attributed that sacrifice to the rain when in most likelihood there's no evidence that that it had any effect at all. So we can't that's an attribution and we'll talk about that when we talk about attribution. When we talk about sensation versus perception, I'll try to clear that up in just a moment with an understanding of what sensation is versus perception. And we'll talk about some of the sub processes of perception as well. When we talk about sensation here is just a reasonably normal person. Looks like she might be working in a call center or something and she is constantly bombarded with sensations and just to overlay. She's got five senses that are engaged and some people may be that six senses, but let's just talk about five. There are the elements that are impacting is it raining? Is it snowing? Is it cold? Is it hot? She's got light or darkness that's impacting. Those are all sensations. There are other stimuli She may see things. She may see people. She may see if she's at a zoo. She's looking at animals. If she's got a computer screen in front of her, she has images she's looking at. There are sounds that are coming through her headset, as well as sounds that are in the background.

It does look like she's in a call center because there are people in the background. And finally, there's the barometric pressure. If she's at if she's working in Denver, Colorado, then the barometric pressure, the pressure on her, on her, on her being is greater than it is less than it is if she's at sea level. So that's sensation. That's a natural occurring event. That is a human being interacting with the environment. That's different than perception. So let's look look at the sub processes of perception so that we can understand the difference. Now go back to the stimuli that we saw in the previous chart, which were the the elements light, other types of stimuli. That is the beginning part of perception. We confront those stimuli. We see an event, we're driving down the highway and we see a car suddenly that's coming at us 100 yards ahead and they're in our lane. Okay, So that's that's the stimulus. The first thing we do is confront the stimulus. We see it. The second thing we do is we register that there is a car and then we interpret that it is in the wrong lane and it's heading for us. Now, we're going to probably want to do something. Maybe we pull to the side of the road, maybe we blast on our horn, maybe we pull to the side of the road and call 911 because the person driving the car either might be out of control or they might be sick, or who knows, they might have had a heart attack or a stroke.

And then the consequence occurs if we pull to the side of the road and it was just a person, maybe you're on a two lane highway and the person was passing, you pull to the side of the road, the person passes, there's no damage. So this is the this is the concept of perception and all of the processes associated with it. So we will we will look at some of those issues that impact perception as well. It's not just the the interpretation is the part of perception that is most widely different among people. We see things and we interpret them differently. And I'll give you some things to look at in just a minute that will challenge your perceptions. I think in some in some way now when we're looking at perceptions, then we selectively our brains selectively pick things out and they tend to organize those things to. Stereotype with our brain, things that become more familiar and can be more easily interpreted. So if we see something and we see we've seen that same thing before, our brain would tend to tell us that that is exactly what we've seen before. So the intensity of things can make something stand out, though. If you see something and it's glowing and it's bright red, you walk into a kitchen and one of the burners, electric burners is bright red.

That intensity of color will alert you that something is different about that burner than the other. Let's say three burners on the stove size as well. The size of something as it contrasts to other things can can certainly give us an indication that that's something worth paying attention to. Anything that's repetitive. If you if you were if I were to put on this chart a motion graphic, in other words, a person running in a circle or something that would draw your attention because it's different than what you've been seeing to date in the presentation. So motion has repetition and motion tend to call call attention, novelty. Any time we see something different, we are our attention is drawn to it. Or as I mentioned earlier, any time we see something familiar, you may have looked in the Sunday comics and often they have two pictures, one on top of the other. It looks just like the other. And they say pick out the 12 things in the bottom picture that's different than the top picture. That's the the idea of novelty or difference. Also in our selection, in the selection of words. I have a comment here and the comment read neutrally says I cannot recommend this person too highly. The perception that you have of that comment could have a lot to do with your knowledge of both the speaker of the words or the writer of the words and the person that we're talking about.

This sentence could be interpreted to mean this person is so good, there's just no way that I could could recommend them to give them enough praise or the interpretation could be this person's reasonably mediocre, so I can't really recommend them too highly. So the perception when we talk about communications, we will talk about the impact of words, intonation, things of that nature to give us cues as to how to perceive this particular sentence from the perspective of the person that actually said it. So these are some of the attention factors and some of the issues to to be aware of. When we look at learning and perception, we if we look at the this picture of three people who. Three men that seem to be reasonably identical looking into a frame, we see that the contrast in the size of the frame visually tells our eyes that maybe the person at the at the top right is larger than the person at the bottom right. The truth of the matter is the the person the size of the figures in the frame are exactly the same. So that's a that's a case of our eyes playing tricks on us. The way we organize our perceptions are organized in our brain, or we look for things like contrast to help us decide exactly how to interpret something.

Something called figure ground. And we'll look at a picture of that. We also look for perceptual grouping, things that are put into groups that we can readily identify. Constancy to make sure that things are the way they should be or the way we think they should be. And finally, context. Context is incredibly important when we talk about perceptions, because the context is what we understand and know already. If there's a new context, we may have a difficult time interpreting that context. Here's an example of contrast. If I were to ask you which black circle is larger, you can see the one on the left is surrounded by larger circles. The one on the right is surrounded by smaller white circles. Your eye might tell you that the one on the right is bigger. They are identical size though, but the contrast might make the right circle. The center circle. The black circle seem higher. So that's an example of contrast. An example of figure ground is that normally this looks like. For those of you who've never seen this, this might look like Klingon writing or something. If and the reason it might look like Klingon writing is that you're probably your brain is probably telling you the information is in the black area. Well, in this case, the information is in the white area. And if you look closely, you'll see that the first letter is an F on the top.

The second letter is an L, third letter is a Y at the bottom. The first letter on the bottom left is T, the middle letter is I, and the letter on the right is I. So it's fly tai. Now it's we call it figure ground because what we have, what our brain has told us initially is that the information should should be in the black. So our brain is expecting the information to be in the black. But the information is really in that white area between the black intersections. When we also look at tricks our eyes can play on us. If you look at this, let me ask you to stare at this for about two seconds and then just write down what you see in this picture. Okay. Very quickly. You could probably see one of two things. You can probably see what seems to be an attractive young woman. Who's. And let me put an arrow here. Who's whose eyes, whose nose is showing to the left and who has. You can see her ear and she's wearing a she's wearing a necklace here. This is her nose and that's her ear. Okay, so that's one picture you might see. Now, let me change your paradigm a little bit and you might see a very old, witchy, shaggy looking woman. This is her mouth. That's her nose.

That appears to be a wart. And that's her eye. So you could be seeing two different things depending on what your brain is is used to interpreting. So once again, your perceptions can be fooled by what your brain is expecting to see. Here's the Fedex logo. There may be something you have never noticed before. This is more of a figure ground and a contrast idea. There's an arrow within the Fedex logo. The arrow is right here. Now, every time you see a Fedex truck or a Fedex box, you'll probably look for that arrow. But it is an unusual thing. Fedex does this, too, as sort of an inside joke if you want to, or an inside element. Part of what we talked about in building the culture is the the folklore behind the culture. This is an arrow that says to the the Fedex employees, always be moving forward, always be helping out, always find a way to do it better. That arrow was pointing in the right direction, which means let's go. Another way that we've actually used camouflage in the past in things like wars is to camouflage. Here's a battleship that's camouflage. This is one. During 1941, the Navy would camouflage their battleships. And the reason is that when an enemy submarine would would have their periscope up and they'd be looking on the surface for battleships, they wouldn't they would look through mist and haze and water.

The conditions weren't always bright in the North Atlantic. They were often overcast. And what they were looking for was the the signature of a battleship. They weren't looking for something as broken up as this picture would be through a periscope. So it helps by breaking up this image with these random patterns. It it helps fool the enemy about about where you're where you're actually located, where your battleship is located. Here's another example of figure figure location. There's really no information here. So. So don't look for the information. But the question you would ask once again is where is the information? Is it in the white or is it in the black context? Very important. This could be doodling. Someone said it looks like it could be the rat race. But if I tell you, it looks like some horses feeding in a trough, maybe that makes a little bit more sense. So that's some of the the images and concepts that can lead to fooling our brain about the perceptions that are that we encounter. Let's take a look at some of the illusions of Escher. An author named or a writer named Escher was a master at creating some illusions that were absolutely astounding, because the more you stare at them, the more impossible they. They realize. You realize they are. You can see if you look carefully at this, you'll see that there are people down here that seem to have come through this gate.

And this seems to be a flat surface until you see that these people are looking down from like something like a balcony. So this whole illusion really is a physical impossibility. But it it certainly does tax your perception. If you stare at the middle of this and count the black dots, don't stare at it too long because it will hurt your brain. You'll see that black dots occur and reoccur all over the place. And once again, that's the your brain is searching for the proper orientation or configuration of there actually are no black dots at all. But it's impossible to know that because every time you look at it, you'll see black dots. And that's because of the contrast of the the figure ground. In this case, we would ask you to look at the lines and are they parallel? They look like they're wavy. That's a trick that's being played on us. They're really parallel. It's just a matter of how you how you how you look at it. As I say, here's an elephant. And if you look carefully, you can see that the elephant either has four legs or six legs or eight legs. Actually, it's more more on the order of six legs. But the idea of the figure ground contrast can actually drive you nuts if you look at this too long. These These are a set of purple lines on a background of sort of yellowish and then red lines.

It looks as if the lines are bent, but they're not. They're absolutely straight. Is another illusion. If you look at this, you can see that there is a man's face and there's also a word. Now the man's face is normally pretty easy to to spot. If you turn your head to the right, about ten degrees, you'll see that the word liar l i a r is spelled out. And then if you turn it back, you can see that the the man's face appears. So that's a bit of an illusion as well. This is another Escher type of situation where the as you can see, we're starting out on the top here. We're coming down this ramp and then we're doing something that appears to be once again impossible. So but it is an illusion that your brain is playing on you. I'd like to play now a very short video clip for you of an illusion. It's called the Little Dragon or the Dragon Illusion. I always have fun watching this. I've probably seen it 100 times and never tire of it. And the reason is it is an illusion that we are going to show you that you'll participate in. And at the very end of the illusion, we will we will destroy the illusion because of the very nature of of the way the illusion is constructed. So our friend, a German researcher, is going to help out with the narration Here.

Here's our little dragon sitting on the window ledge. But look what happens the minute we move his head, twists and turns to follow us as we move around the room. It's all an illusion. Of course, he's not really moving at all. It's a version of the hollow face illusion, but it's a very powerful effect and not just side to side. If we move up and down again, his head cranes to follow us. But our brain has made an assumption about the structure of the dragon's head. And if we move far enough around to the side, we suddenly realize the structure is different and the illusion fails.

So you can see that our perceptions, the things that we perceive to be aren't always what reality portends for us. The what that what does that mean in the context of organizational behavior, what it means as leaders and as individuals? This is a key skill for individuals as well as leaders is before you let your perceptions drive your decisions, do some investigation, understand what's really there. Try to understand as best you can the real situation so that you can make enlightened and informed decisions. Let's talk a little bit now about social perceptions, because they're important. When we when we perceive someone in a social setting, we are perceiving them as. Based on their characteristics and also based on what our understandings of the world are. So if you see a person that's approaching you and they're very sloppily dressed and they have long hair and they look like they haven't had a bath in a while, that without seeing them before, that probably is going to color your perception of that person. So your perception. Let's say one of those people that think that cleanliness is is really, really important and a person looks a little bit dirty, it may be that your perceptions that we colored by by that particular encounter, once again, it pays to it pays great dividends to be able to investigate a little bit further and find out the reasons why this person looks the way they do.

Maybe they don't care about their behavior, maybe they're brilliant, maybe they're good at what they do. Maybe they're the friendliest person in the world. But you may not know that you may encounter someone who has a horrible look on their face, a grimace. They have this terrible countenance. And you may think, well, that's the most unhappy person in the world or the most mean person in the world might turn out that that person has a migraine headache that day. And if it's the first time you've seen them, you're going to take away a certain amount of perception about what that person's all about. I know first impressions are important. It's part of our human nature that we part of our survival mechanism, that we look at a certain event. We make a decision about it and we behave in a certain way. I would say when it comes to dealing with people, always give individuals a second chance to make that first impression and you'll be better off, and I think they'll be better off as well. We talk about stereotyping, we're talking about looking at a person and attributing attributing certain characteristics to that person. Withoutrillioneally knowing whether the person meets those characteristics or not. So we might we hear that the typical blonde jokes and if you believe that blondes are less intelligent than other people, then that's a stereotype. It's not wise for you to believe that because intelligence seems to be evenly distributed according to hair color.

The halo effect is somewhat the inverse of stereotyping in that the halo effect says that just because a person can do one thing well. You believe that they can do everything well? This tends to be a very significant problem when we come to when it comes to promotions. Often organizations will take the most talented technical person and presume that since they're really good, technically, well, they will be really, really good as a supervisor. They may not have the skills to be a supervisor. They may not be a good communicators. They may not have empathy. They may not be good at building relationships, all which are important to being a good supervisor. But the halo effect says that since I believe that they're really good, technically, I believe they're going to be good at everything. And we tend we tend to see that. So that's something to be cautious about in in making judgments about other people. Let's shift gears for just a moment and talk a little bit about attribution, and then we'll take a very short break and think about some of the topics we've covered this morning. We talk about attribution, what we're talking about is how do we determine the meaning of things? In other words, an event occurs and we want to we want to make some sense out of it.

One of the things that we really focus on is what's called locus of control. We're going to look at Kelly's attribution theory, which focuses on locus of control. Locus of control indicates where the circumstance occurred. In other words, what caused something to happen? Did it happen because of some external factor or external force that's acting on on the situation? The conspiracy theorists tend to want to attribute everything that happens to some kind of a broad conspiracy. Or, for example, if I if I'm if I'm taking a course and I don't do well on the test, the midterm exam, I can say I didn't study well. I know I didn't study well. And if I if I want to do better in the future, I'm going to have to study. Or I could say the teacher doesn't like me. The test was biased. This stuff's not important. Anyway, The the the last example is an example of an external locus of control. The first example where I look at myself and say, well, you know, I really wasn't able to study, so I didn't do well on the test. That's an internal locus of control and we tend to see those in organizations more and more these days where people want to place blame, if you will, on some circumstance other than their own. Now, there could be some errors in attribution that we make.

Uh, we could have a self-serving bias in that. We're looking out for our own interests. We could have fundamental attribution errors where we simply misunderstand the situation and try to apply attribution logic to it. So let's take a look at Kelly's views of external attribution first, which is to say that when something occurs, an individual believes that there are external circumstances that are driving that. And it's it's not really something that the individual has control over. There are ways that you can determine as as a supervisor or manager or leader, whether it truly is external attribution. I'm not saying that the external world doesn't impact our ability to do things sometimes. Often it does. But to use that as an excuse, we can look at three areas. We can look at consensus, consistency and distinctiveness. So let's take a task. We have worker, we have Abe, the worker who is is having some difficulty with a task. So we want to look at a couple of things. First of all, let's look at consensus. Are other people who are attempting the task doing poorly as well? If they are, then that's high consensus and it's a good chance that may be the task that's doing it. Let's look at consistency. The subordinate, the person, Abe, that we've pointed out, doesn't perform well on this task only during a single time period. There's some point during the task or initially during the task maybe Abe didn't do very well.

That would be consistently. And finally, does the subordinate we're talking about Abe here perform well on other tasks, but not on this one. It may be something about this task that would lead Abe to not be able to do it. Maybe it's not within his skill set. Maybe it's something that that he's not well suited for and that if all of these if it was highly consistent, in other words, other people couldn't do it either. If he performed sometimes well and sometimes not, then it's low consistency. And if other if he performs well on other tasks, but not this one, that's high distinctiveness. That is a case where external attribution probably is the cause. There probably is something outside of Abe that's causing this problem to occur. However, let's look at the the opposite of that, which is internal attribution. And let's see if in this case, maybe Abe is the one that needs to study a little harder to get a better grade or learn the skill a little bit. If other coworkers are performing well on the task, then that's low consensus and that's not an indicator of external attribution. If he does not do well on the task at any time under any circumstances, then it's highly his performance is highly consistent. If the he performs well, Abe performs poorly on all tasks. He's just not a good performer.

Then the task is not the distinctive nature of the distinctive driver of what's wrong. The task is not the driver. So Abe is apparently not suited for this task and it may be time to think about some other task or some other line of work. Even so, that would be internally. The the factors that cause Abe not to perform are inside Abe. They're not inside the environment. So we've taken a look at perception and we've taken a very quick ride through perception and attribution. These are important things to understand when we try to understand the world, because first of all, I want to leave you with with the idea that none of us has complete knowledge. None of us sees the world exactly as it is. Everyone has a different viewpoint because it's like we're all looking out of windows, but they're all different windows. Looking at a slightly different scene. Remember the Dragon illusion where we saw something that we believed to be true, and then when we saw the truth of the matter, our illusions were shattered. So I'd like you to think about some of these things. Think about in your everyday life, have you encountered internal and external attribution? Have you encountered perceptual errors? What were they and how would you react differently in the future with the knowledge that you have? So let's take a very short break and think about those things.",6198,"[-0.01356644  0.01604132  0.01823112 ... -0.01930659 -0.01548415

Cognitive Theories of Motivation,5.1,ACO,"Title: Cognitive Theories of Motivation; Description: In the video for ENMA 601 Analysis of Complex Organizations, the instructor discusses several key takeaways related to the impact of rewards on individual behavior, the role of goals in motivation, and the importance of fairness and justice in organizational settings. The instructor begins by asking students to reflect on their experiences with higher order needs being met, highlighting the significance of this aspect in motivation. They then delve into Victor Vroom's expectancy model, explaining the importance of valence, expectancy, and instrumentality in understanding motivation. The instructor provides examples to illustrate how these factors can vary across cultures and how they can be influenced by reward systems.
Next, the equity model by Stacy Adams is introduced, emphasizing the importance of perceived fairness or inequity in inputs and rewards. The instructor explains how knowledge of inequity can affect job satisfaction and provides an example of pay discrepancies among coworkers. The graphic comparing inputs to rewards further reinforces the concept of equity and its impact on satisfaction.
Moving on to goal theory, the instructor highlights the rationality of individuals and their motivation towards goals that they understand and accept. Stretch goals and feedback mechanisms are emphasized as crucial aspects in maintaining motivation and performance. The video ends with a discussion on organizational justice, stressing the significance of fairness and openness within organizations. The instructor encourages leaders to build trust, treat individuals equally, and create a positive work environment.
Additionally, the video briefly introduces Porter and Lawler's integrative theory, which emphasizes various factors such as valence, effort, perception of role, and self-efficacy in motivating individuals. Mitchell's integrative model is also mentioned, acknowledging the multiple factors that contribute to motivation and performance.
Overall, the key takeaways from this video highlight the importance of fairness in reward systems, the role of goals in motivation, and the significance of organizational justice in creating a positive work environment. The instructor emphasizes the need for leaders to ensure fairness, provide equal access to information, and integrate justice into organizational systems and processes. The various motivational theories discussed provide insights into effectively managing and engaging employees, understanding their needs, and reinforcing positive behavior.; Transcript: Welcome back. I hope you've had an opportunity to think about a time when maybe some of your higher order needs were met. I'd like you to submit that with your homework for this chapter, so I'll get a sense of how well you're relating to the things we're talking about. Now, I'd like to switch gears a little bit. We've talked about the content theories. I'd like to talk about some of the cognitive theories of motivation that that play an important role, too. And I think you'll see there's some strong validity in these as well. The one of the first I want to talk about is the expectancy model that was developed by Victor Vroom. He was the originator of this theory. And of course, he it has been expanded by many, many others to add some more depth and texture to it. He says that in motivation there are really three things you have to be concerned about. I really like this model because it fits so naturally with the content models. One is Valence. First of all, if you're giving a person a reward, they've got to want to want the reward. It's unique to everyone, but it can be cultural in nature. For example, let's say that you're designing a reward system and you have a very strong let's say you're working in Japan and you're running a factory there and you design an individual reward system. Well, that might even be a sense of shame for a Japanese person because they're so they're so socially oriented, they're so collectively oriented that it might not be something that you actually want to give.

I was doing a session with a group of people and I saw a person sort of light up in the audience, and I got him at the break and I said, You know, when I was talking about this valence, you seem to relate. And he says, Yeah, we have a large organization. He said, We have a monthly luncheon with the director, and there's one director that everybody absolutely hates, so nobody wants to win that award. Well, that's an example of low valence. If the reward is considered to be if you win, you're the loser, then that's low valence. So you've got to make sure that when you're designing any kind of recognition, reward or motivation, that the valence is appropriate to the task at hand. The next is the expectancy model, if I believe. That my efforts are actually going to help in achieving a goal, then that's expectancy. So I believe that it's based on self efficacy, this idea that I can do something that that that I have a high sense of task, high, high, high sense of task, self efficacy, then that creates high expectancy. If I think that I can do it and it'll make a difference, that's expectancy. Instrumentality is another important one.

It's a belief that a reward will be received at the task is completed. I can tell you about a personal experience. Many years ago I worked for a company that was that was woeful. It was it was pitiful in the fact that at the corporate level, they couldn't seem to do anything right. They had just gone through a merger. To this day, they have 1987 was the merger. To this day, they haven't recovered from the merger. They just seem to exist, almost subterranean in a subterranean fashion. Well, I had in all of my career as an executive in the in industry. I had the very best bonus and compensation plan at that company that I ever had. Now, I said I had the best plan. I never achieved the plan because in order for me to get my bonus, which was going to be 150% of my annual salary so I could get 150% more than my annual salary. If my bonus levels came through, the company had to meet their levels, so there was no way the company was ever going to meet their goals. They never did. It didn't matter really how well I met my goals. I wasn't going to get any of my bonuses. So that's an example of a bonus system that is not motivational. After a while, people begin to see through it. So if you believe that a reward will be received at the task is completed, is instrumentality.

Another example where we see instrumentality in its fullest extent is especially in commission systems. There's a reverse side of of of this instrumentality. Let's say that you are a sales person and 90% of your pay is based on commission and your commission is capped at a certain level. So I know the instrumentality is I know that if I achieve goals up to a certain level, I'll get the maximum compensation. What happens if I achieve my goals by September of the year and I've got October, November and December? I'm not going to work very hard if I can't make any more money in my commission. So that's another example of instrumentality at work in this concept of the expectancy model. Motivation then, is valence times expectancy times instrumentality. Vie is also the the acronym for this particular model. Now, Vroom's model assumes rationality and human behavior, and it can help us understand as leaders, how people might view a reward or an outcome or an expectancy occurrence so that we are not designing systems that don't work for everyone. Once again, getting to know our people is the best way to avoid some of these problems. So the way the model works here is the person exerts effort on the in the expectancy is can I complete the task they perform the task. The instrumentality is what work outcomes will be received as a result of performance.

In other words, did I make a difference that I help the outcome? And then there's outcomes. How valid, how highly do I value this outcome? How important is it to me if we also look at it on a scale here? The one thing that to keep in mind is that valence could have avoidance. If the reward is is incorrectly configured, I may actually be trying to avoid that particular reward reward because I don't want to have lunch with that director or I don't want to be involved in in a group or an individual award ceremony when I believe the group is who who put together and made made the recognition possible. Another model that a cognitive model that's important is the equity model. With Stacy Adams. A great deal of work has been done in this equity model. This is very important because this is why organizations like to keep things like pay secret. This theory argues that any major input into job performance is the degree of equity or inequity that people perceive. Now we can have a situation where a person is perfectly happy. In their ignorance of any inequities. But once they find out that there's an inequity, they could be unhappy. So there are different ways that we can look at this. This may be a person may be, as I said, perfectly happy. Then they find that there's an inequity and they are very, very unhappy once they find that.

So what what happened? What tends to happen in our lives at work is we look at our input, we compare it to others. We don't we don't sit down and make a list, but we kind of look around and see who's doing what to whom. We look at the effort they're putting forward their education. Where do they go to school? What are the kind of grades do they get, that sort of thing, Any input into a process? And then we look at the outputs, we look at their pay, their benefits, the rewards, how does the organization value them? And we're going to make a comparison on a regular basis here. Now, this is very important because if people perceive that there are inequities, they could go from being very happy to being very unhappy in a in a in a stroke of of a pen sort of. So let me give you a real life example. Two young ladies that grew up together, they knew each other since kindergarten. They went to high school together. They went to grade school together. They actually went to the same college, majored in the same thing, pretty much got identical grades because they went to the same classes. They studied together. So they both graduated with a pretty good GPA, went to work together in the same department, doing the same thing. They worked there for a couple of years.

So Mary and Alice are the two individuals. Now, one day, 2 or 3 years, let's say it's three years into their working together, doing the same thing, having the same working the same hours, really no difference. They're interchangeable. Alice comes into their cubicle, which they share, and Alice notices there's a piece of paper on on the floor. She picks up the piece of paper, looks at it to see what it is, and she sees that it's Mary's pay stub. She notes that Mary is making 20% more than she is. Everything else is equal. In the instant that Alice recognized that there was that inequity, she went from happy and satisfied to unhappy and probably went to her boss and said, Why is Mary making more than me? Even though in the absence of that knowledge, she was perfectly happy. So that's how equity tends to work. And it's a very important theory when we when we think about doling out rewards recognition. And I'm not just talking about dollar bills, I'm talking about if you pay too much attention to one person or you praise one person too much and don't praise other people who have similar accomplishments, those can all be equity issues. If a person is seen as being a pet or favorite of the management, that could be an equity issue. If we if you look at the the a graphic that sort of compares that we're looking, as I said, at the inputs compared to the rewards that we're getting.

And if there's a perceived equity, a person's satisfied, if there's discomfort, then that may be perceived inequity and a person might actually take some some steps to overcome it. For example, if the inequity reaction, the person finds this thing out, they may say, well, you know, maybe I'm not working as hard as I could. So they they could. They Now, let me let me back up just a bit. This could work in the opposite direction, too. Alice could have picked up that paycheck and seen that Mary was making 20% less. That would be an inequity, too. And she may feel like, well, maybe I should work harder if I'm making more. However, if she feels like she's under-rewarded, she may slow down a little bit. She may say, you know, I'm not going to work this hard if they're not going to reward me. The other thing that could happen is if the reward was if you feel like you were over rewarded, you might discount the value of the work. You know, 20% is not that much. If you feel like you're under rewarded, you may actually say, well, 20% is a lot, so you may inflate the value. Now, in in in in interacting with the organization, one of the things that might happen if you're over rewarded is to go to the person.

Alice could go to Mary and say, you know, I saw that your paycheck was 20% less than mine. They might not say that, but might say, you know, you ought to try to get a pay raise. I think you're worth more. However, if if Mary's paycheck was bigger, then Alice might go to the boss and say, you know what? You've got to pay me more. This is not fair. I do the same thing. I'm just as good. I may even quit. People have resigned over this, over pay. I've had people resign over perceived inequity issues. And finally, if all else fails, in both cases, you might just say, well, you know, Mary is not the person I should be looking at. It's other people. In both cases now, the most important thing about any reward system. Is fairness. Keep that in mind. That's let me say that again. The most important thing about any reward system is, is fairness. If people perceive that what's being done is fair, maybe it's not the most effective thing in the world, but it's fairly administered then, then then that's a step in the right direction. If pay is administered based on objective factors that are objective as possible, then then that's a good thing. So any system is going to have a degree of relative satisfaction because people are could feel over under rewarded. This inequities could be true, could be real inequities, it could be perceived inequities.

But be aware that this can be a serious problem in organizations. Let me shift gears a bit and go into another element of our of our cognitive theories, which is goal theory, kind of the the masthead, if you will, of the. These these motivational type approaches. Gold theory says that people are rational. So not only the rational, they're aware, so they'll act in their best interest and they know what they're doing. They set goals. They make goals. Maybe they don't sit and write them down in excruciating detail, but they have goals. Therefore, if we if we believe that that's true, then goals should be there to motivate and guide us toward meeting the goal. If if you want. My wife is a runner. And I tend to ride my bike when she runs. She she just recently ran a half a half marathon. She will run another one in in later on this year. And my role is to help her train. And she gets out and has a training schedule and I take my bike and go with her to keep her company. Well, her goal is to achieve a certain time in that marathon race. Now she knows that. So she knows she can't just show up on the day of the race and start running. She's going to have to train. So there is a conscious cognitive effort on her part to prepare.

Now, that fact that she wants to run and do well in that marathon motivates her and guides her preparation towards satisfying the goal. She knows because she's been running for many years that she can't just show up, not do any training and expect to do well. Now, the goal theory says that we're aware of our goals. We know what has to be done to achieve them. And if we're motivated, we will do that. Now, what are what is a good goal? How do we achieve a good goal? First of all, and the most important and foundational of goal theory is the goal has to be understood and accepted by the individual. In other words, the individual must want to be involved in in achieving the goal. Very important that organizations. That's why it's important to work with people on their goals to understand what's in it, for them to see that they're achieving some higher level order of motivation out of the goal, that they're learning, that they're growing, they're getting some esteem or status. The goals also have to be as precise as possible and somewhat difficult to achieve, but not impossible. If the goal is if the goal on your first trip out is to climb Mount Everest or the first time you run is to run the Boston Marathon, then that's too big. But if you start out by saying, I'm going to run, I'm going to practice every day and I'm going to run a ten K race in six months, that's a reasonable goal.

It's a stretch goal because you can't do it now, Assuming you can, you can't. It's difficult to achieve, but it's a good motivator and it's a good predictor of performance. The other thing that's important is a feedback mechanism. Keeping score is so important. Now. I've had a lot of experience in my life with weight loss, so I can tell you that one of the key elements of weight loss, if you're involved in that, is to weigh yourself. That's a feedback mechanism. And if you go a week and you weigh yourself and you lose £2, that's motivational. You're meeting your goal. If you don't, then that can be demotivating and you might have to change something or it may motivate you to get back on your plan of exercise and diet. By the way, the secret to weight loss is, is I'm going to reveal it for the first time. It's eat less and exercise more so. Let's talk about one of our final elements here in the process, theories, which is organizational justice. This is very important to most individuals, and it relates very strongly to goal theory as well as to equity theory. The in an organization that treats people fairly, that treats people openly, that tends to not single out individuals for both single praise or single condemnation tend to be the ones that are are the most effective.

The values that an that an individual brings into an organization certainly does influence the way they feel about the organization. And certainly the environment and the organization influences the way people perceive that organization. So the way that we are surrounded, part of social cognitive theory is that our organizational environment does drive our behavior. Building trust in an organization is one of the most important things that an organization can do. What the leaders can can do is to make sure that there is justice. For example, in handing out rewards, recognition bonuses, making sure that the people getting the rewards truly have earned them, that they're not getting the rewards because of someone else's work. I don't know how many times that I've encountered organizations where the boss takes credit for all the work and doesn't give any any reference to the people who actually did it. Fairness in Procedures. I worked with an organization once and they had low morale and didn't know why. And the reason was that they were things like tuition assistance was left up to the discretion of the supervisor, and the supervisor would use it to punish people that he didn't like. So if you if you've got to have fairness in the process and if the policy says one thing and you do another, that's not fair. Fairness in the interpersonal interaction, if the there's not justice in the way that the higher level operators in the organization deal with others, then there's going to be a lack of justice.

In other words, if 1 or 2 people get all the attention and other people don't get the attention or are snubbed, then that's going to be a lack of seen as a lack of justice. Also, in handing out information, who gets the inside information? Who knows what's going on? This is a big motivator for most people to be treated like they are an insider in the organization and they know what's going on. And the lack of that can cause a feeling of a lack of justice. So justice is important. I encourage organizational leaders to think about how just their systems are, how just their interpersonal relationships are. And do they do they think about justice when they design something? When you design a reward system, or are you thinking about things like how can I make sure the right people get this? Finally, let's talk a little bit about some extrinsic motivators and the integrative theory. Porter and Lawler have what you might consider to be an integrative theory that puts together things like Vroom's VI model as well as others. And it starts with, first of all, this concept of valence. If you see the one here, that's the first step. And the valence with the Valence says is that I've got to make sure that the reward really means something before I decide how much effort I'm going to put in it.

So I've got to look at first I look at is the reward worth it? How much effort am I going to have to put into it to achieve to get a high probability of achieving the reward? So then I decide I'm going to put the effort forward. It's worth it. I can do it. Then I've got things like effort that I put into it. I look at my perception of my role in the organization. Is this something that I'll be recognized for? Is it something that I that I'm capable of doing? I look at my abilities, my traits, I look at my self equity or self-efficacy to see that I really have the ability to do it. And then I do the thing and it actually achieves what we expected it to achieve. I'm going to get some intrinsic rewards which are going to be the satisfaction of accomplishing the task, the self esteem that comes with the recognition. And I might even get some extrinsic rewards, which might be a cash bonus or something like that. And only then after the the reward is seen to be an equitable award. In other words, it was what was promised and it's fair. Am I satisfied? So this model is a little different than some of the other models we've looked at in that what it says is accomplishment drives satisfaction.

It's not and not necessarily that satisfaction drives accomplishment. So this is a little bit different. The the contributions that Porter and Lawler made cannot be overemphasized because they're very important. The barriers to this are things like if people don't feel like they have the abilities or the knowledge to achieve the task, that could be a barrier. The task could be impossible. So the person could be frustrated in doing it. They may not exactly know back with goal theory. They may not be clear on what the goal really is. All of those could frustrate Porter and Lawler's model. Final model that I want to take a look at is something that and then we've got a feedback loop, of course, here. Mitchell's integrative model. This is an excellent model because what it says is there's so many things that go into motivation and performance. There's the content of the job. There's the motivational processes such am I interested in what I'm doing? Is there a level of intensity that's going to drive me? Do I have the ability, the knowledge? Do I care enough about this task to want to get involved? And if I do, am I going to put the effort into it or am I going to stick with it? When time gets times get tough? And am I going to develop strategies for achieving that task, which will be important? So I've got on the left hand the facilitators and the limiters and on the right hands, the skills and abilities.

All of those have to be present to achieve performance in the task. So we are we we see that the integrative model, although it's called a model, really, really says that there are many, many things that contribute to performance. Just to summarize what we've talked about in this module. If we try to understand that there are a lot of motivational theories out there and not a single theory explains everything, it helps us to to have a wider range of tools in dealing with humans. Humans appear to have needs. And if you don't know what those are because you don't know your people, then they can be dissatisfied and not be as productive as they could. Reinforcement certainly is important. We're going to talk about that in future sessions, if you want. What gets done is what's reinforced. And as I mentioned, no single theory contributes all the complete wisdom to understanding how people operate in behaviors and behave in organizations. For the next session. Before we before we get back together, I'd like you to read Chapter seven Positive Organizational Behavior and complete the homework assignment for Module five. I certainly have enjoyed this session. Motivation is is a critically important topic and understanding organizations, and I look forward to our next meeting.",5396,"[-0.04124319 -0.01335333  0.01046032 ... -0.01885329  0.01414646

Emotional intelligence,6.1,ACO,"Title: Emotional intelligence; Description: In this video, the key takeaway is the concept of emotional intelligence. The instructor begins by asking students to think about people who bring out the best and worst in them, and the qualities associated with those experiences. He explains that emotional intelligence refers to an individual's ability to know and manage themselves, as well as manage relationships with others. The four elements of emotional intelligence discussed are self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management. Self-awareness involves understanding and reading one's own emotions, recognizing triggers, and being aware of strengths and weaknesses. Self-management focuses on controlling emotions, being transparent, adaptable, and optimistic. Social awareness involves understanding the emotions of others, practicing empathy, and being service-oriented. Relationship management refers to inspiring and motivating others, resolving conflicts, and building teams. The instructor highlights the importance of emotional intelligence for leadership, explaining that leaders with high emotional intelligence are calm, outgoing, empathetic, and confident. In contrast, high IQ alone is not a strong predictor of success or job performance. Emotional intelligence, on the other hand, correlates more strongly with handling challenges, managing emotions, and maintaining positive relationships. The instructor assigns homework on practicing empathetic listening to improve social awareness. He emphasizes the value of positive organizational behavior and encourages students to explore other types of intelligences, such as social intelligence. The video ends with a reminder to complete the homework and midterm exam.; Transcript: Before the break, I asked you to think about two people that you may have known in your life. That could have been a coworker, a supervisor, a friend. And the two people that brought out the best and the worst in you. And what I would would like you to have done was to written down on a piece of paper on one side, the best and one side the worst. These are some of the typical responses that I've gotten in doing this exercise in in the past. Words like for the best words like kindness. Patience, understanding, caring about me and others. Empathetic, secure, fun, a good listener. On the worst side, I've seen things like petty and mean, vindictive, fearful, selfish, uncaring, cold, brutal. What we have displayed here is a clear example of emotional intelligence on the side of the ledger where we see the characteristics and behaviors of people that were brought out the best in us. That tends to be elements of those tend to be elements of of positive emotional intelligence. When we see the worst, the pettiness, the meanness, the addictiveness, those tend to be elements of of a lack of emotional intelligence. So let's take a look at this whole thing that we're calling emotional intelligence. What exactly is it? Here's a good definition. I think that tends to provide a good foundation for this discussion. Emotional intelligence is an individual's ability to know and manage oneself along with an awareness and ability to manage one's relationships with others.

What that simply means is. That if we have emotional intelligence, then our first element of that is we understand our own emotions, that we are very clear about how we feel about things. We recognize the triggers that make us happy and unhappy, and we are able to understand when we're changing emotional states. The second part is having knowing that we are able to manage ourselves in a sense that we don't lose our temper or that we don't have what are called hijacks, that we don't explode in situations where it could be disastrous to it. The third element is what we call social awareness. In other words, the ability, as we see here in this chart, to understand the emotions of others. Now, now as we go up the scale from self awareness to self management, those are easier than social awareness. Social awareness can be a very difficult task, but it is something you can learn. The beauty of all of this, of this study of emotional intelligence is it's not like IQ. You're not locked in to what your emotional intelligence is. You can improve it and it is more powerful than IQ. So that's even better. That even trumps the the fact that IQ is an is is an important but not as important as IQ. And finally, the goal of this is to create positive relationships with others in the places where you work and live at home, at work, at church, in your social events. All of that applies.

So emotional intelligence is not something you bring to work and leave there or something you you leave at home. It's something you take with you everywhere. So these are the four elements of emotional intelligence. Let me talk about each one of them. When we talk about self-awareness, it's the ability to understand and read our own emotions. Listening to those gut feelings, trying to understand what they're telling us, being able to accurately know what we're good at, what we're not good at, being able to accurately know the kinds of things that set us off, the kinds of words, the people. Sometimes they're just a person that really drives you batty. And just looking at that person kind of upsets you, knowing that is important. If you know what, you can do something about it. The self confidence is the understanding of your own self-worth, your capabilities, being able to act with confidence and self efficacy. If we get added to that in the areas that you are that you're sure you can, you can accomplish. So as the first part of a personal competence is self awareness. The second part is self management. Can you control your emotions? Can you recognize them? That's the first step of self awareness. But secondarily, can you recognize them? Can you keep those disruptive emotions under control? Now? The impulses are natural, they're genetic, they're built in. We have a part of our brain called the amygdala that tells us that there's an event that is going to to make us emotionally upset.

The ability of humans, however, to bypass the amygdala and use our prefrontal cortex or our emotional brain center decision center to override that is very, very powerful. So the ability to to override those disruptive emotions and not cause problems that are uncomfortable or career threatening for us is very important. Transparency, being honest. When we when we study leadership, we're going to find that the most important trait of a leader is, to be honest, adaptability, being flexible, resilient in situations, having goals that you want to achieve. Having a drive for achievement is a part of self management having initiative, which is another part of achievement. And finally, optimism. Seeing the upside in events is an important part of self of self management. Now if we do very well at the personal competencies, we can do very well at managing ourselves, but understanding others, since we live in a world with other people is equally important. Social awareness is the ability to interact with another person and get a sense of what's going on in their lives. Now, if we look back on that list of of good things that people brought out in us, then we would see that there's a lot of social awareness there. The caring is is empathy. Both of those are social awareness. When we look on the negative side, we tend to see things like the inability to read the the emotions of others. There's a story that Dr. Goldman, Doctor Daniel Goldman, who is one of the leading researchers in this area, tells about a woman who goes to a doctor and the doctor tells her that she's got a very serious condition and she'll have to have surgery.

So the woman breaks down in tears. She's crying and the doctor says, What's wrong with you? Why are you crying? And she indicates, Well, you know, you just gave me some really bad news. This is a shock to me. And he says, if you're going to cry, you're going to have to leave my office. And of course, she did leave the office and found a new doctor. Complete lack of of an ability to relate to another person. That ability is called empathy. Our ability to read another person's emotions, to read their state and to be able to put ourselves in their mindset is the skill of empathy. And I've got an exercise I'm going to ask you to engage in and document for me that is going to help you improve your empathy. The ability also to look at your organization, read the current, see who the informal leaders are, see how decision makers are made, and look at politics and how those politics pervade. The organization is important. And finally, people with a high degree of social awareness tend to be service oriented. How can we help? They really genuinely mean that, and that is an element of social awareness. The final element of our social competence is relationship management, the ability to inspire others, the ability to work well with others, the ability to resolve disagreements in in a positive fashion, the ability to see the other person's point of view.

So what we tend to see with people that are high in this relationship management is they're very, very good at motivating people. They're very good at persuading people. They are able to bolster other people's abilities by using feedback and guidance. They are interested in developing people. In other words, they like they get a kick out of seeing people do well. They are good at initiating change and making sure that it that it happens across a wide range of of applications. They're good at resolving conflict and they're very, very good at building teams. Now a key component of leadership. Great leaders tend to have a high degree of emotional intelligence. We've seen that throughout history. We see it today. Some of the the high IQ versus high IQ. If a person I'm sure you've met leaders who are really, really bright. They were so smart that it almost hurt to look at them. They just had brilliant things to say. But they tend to often be critical or condescending. They're emotionally distant. They're not easy to get to know, and they're not the kind of people you really want to spend a lot of time with. Now, when we look at leaders with high EQ, they tend to be cool and calm in situations where things aren't going well. They're outgoing. They really believe in people. They believe in causes, they're empathetic, and they're incredibly confident in their abilities and in the abilities of others, and they show it.

Now, these tend to be leaders that really scale high, both on EQ and leadership abilities. When we talk about IQ intelligence quotient, it's something we're born with. It accounts for somewhere between 20 and 25% of success in our careers. It's a very weak predictor, though, for achievement, especially in an organization where we have to deal with other people. It's very weak predictor for job performance success because if you can't get it, it doesn't matter how bright you are. If you can't get along with other people, then you're going to have a very difficult time in an interactive workplace. And it has a very weak predictor for success, happiness, wealth, any of that. And it can only account for for about 25% or so of career success. Eq or emotional quotient. The ability to improve your your emotional quotient is a much better predictor. People that have a high degree of EQ tend to be able to handle things as they come along much better. They manage their own emotions. They understand the other people in the organization and can read their emotions and they tend to develop and maintain positive relationships over time. They have a lot of friends, they have a lot of people they interact with, and those are valued relationships. Now, what I want you to do as part of your homework is I want you to practice this concept of social awareness, and I want you to do it by applying something called empathy.

Here's the exercise that I want you to engage in a little background. First of all, sometimes when we're talking to a person, our brains get very caught up in what we're going to say, how we're going to respond. We're not even listening to what the other person says being an insensitive listener like that is not transparent. People can see that you're not listening, and it's a huge obstacle in developing a positive relationship. So I want you to use this exercise to to start developing this empathetic listening ability. And I want you to document what you've done for me. Here's the process. So I want you to pick about three conversations. Make sure they're low risk conversations. You don't want to get into a situation where your life or the life of the nation is on the line. Try it first in a low risk situation. So in a conversation, listen empathetically. Don't interrupt the person that's talking. Let them talk. If you feel the need to say something, count to ten. If you feel the need to say something after ten, count to 20. Keep counting. Count to three, ten. Whatever you need, don't talk. It doesn't mean go to sleep or be emotionless. Give them. What I'm saying is don't give them feedback. Don't play back your home movies into their problem. Listen to what they have to say. Don't be expressionless. You can you can nod your head.

You can say, yes, I understand. But learn to be engaged in these conversations. Nod your head, make sure that they know that you're in it. This is going to be challenging for some people because we like to interrupt. We like to give our point of view. We think people are coming to us because they want an answer. Often they're coming to us because they just want to talk. They want to they want to talk about something. They trust you. They want to see that that you're listening. So what you want to do in this exercise is validate their trust in you. And. And listen. Just listen. With all your being. Do that for three people. What I want you to do is try it out with three people, write a few paragraphs on what happened, how you practiced empathy, what results you received, whether it worked out, is it making you better and more effective, and put that in your chapter six homework so I can take a look at it. Now. Don't use names of actual people. You can say, I talked to a coworker, I talked to a supervisor and interesting things will happen. I would stay away from romantic interests, at least until you get good at this. The odd thing about this is in all the times I've done this, it's mostly very successful. The times when it's not sometimes occurs with people in romantic relationships and one person gets suspicious. Why are you suddenly listening to me? I'm a little suspicious.

So oddly enough, human nature tends to intervene. We've talked today about positive organizational behavior. It's based on analyzing our individual strengths instead of looking at what we're bad at and taking a look at what we're good at. These these psycap or positive psychological capabilities or capital include things like self-efficacy, optimism, hope, resiliency, happiness, subjective well-being and emotional intelligence, which we spent a bit of time talking about. This is a great promise in this, and I hope if you do future research that you'll be able to engage in this area because it's something that will improve your life, I think, and inspire you and enlighten you. There are lots of other types of intelligences too, other than just IQ or EQ, and a lot of research is being done into elements such as social intelligence. For our next session. We will. There's two articles. There are no chapters in the book on communications. Oddly enough. There used to be in this in this book, but not in this current edition. The articles Yo, listen up In dialogue, the ultimate communication. So complete the homework assignment and also complete the midterm exam which will be in your packet or will be provided to you by your proctor. Ivan totally enjoyed this session today. This is an area of much research for me and some positive benefits in my life by practicing some of these things. So I look forward to our next session and enjoy your homework and enjoy the midterm exam.",3367,"[-0.03747278  0.00240561  0.02847321 ... -0.02328702 -0.00215456

The Decision Making Process,7.1,ACO,"Title: The Decision Making Process; Description: In this video transcript, the key takeaways revolve around decision-making processes, the importance of involving team members in decision-making, and the role of creativity in generating innovative solutions. The speaker emphasizes the need for a blend of risk aversion and a focus on people to achieve effective decision-making outcomes. The normative decision model is introduced, highlighting the factors that determine the level of group involvement in decision-making processes, such as decision quality, group importance, leader information, and shared goals. The concept of participative decision-making techniques is discussed, emphasizing the importance of involving the team in important decisions while acknowledging that not every decision requires team consensus. The significance of creativity in group decision-making is explored, with a focus on divergent thinking and cognitive complexity in generating innovative solutions. Techniques to foster creativity, such as keeping a journal and using guided imagery, are suggested. Different decision-making techniques, including the Delphi technique and the nominal group technique, are mentioned as effective tools for generating and refining ideas. The importance of effective communication, both verbal and nonverbal, is emphasized, along with the need for leaders to actively engage and listen to their team members. The video concludes with a mention of the upcoming session on stress and conflict and an encouragement for students to complete the assigned reading and homework before the next session. Overall, the video highlights the key takeaways of effective decision-making processes, involving team members, and fostering creativity in complex organizations.; Transcript: We're back. I'd like to spend a few moments talking about how to inspire people through communications. We'll give some background and then I'll give you at least one good example. There are other leaders who we have leaders throughout history, in particular political leaders that have given us great examples of inspiring communications. The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King is one. We will actually hear an excerpt from a speech that he gave in 1963 that may have actually changed the fate of a nation. And that's the United States. It was the middle of the civil rights movement. This speech probably did more to mobilize people in Congress and the nation to change the civil, to increase the the civil rights, to give people their God given rights that had been taken away from them in different states. And the way that King does it is magnificent. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was a great speaker. He was able to use metaphors, was able to inspire people during the depths of the Great Depression. Ronald Reagan was a great speaker and could speak to the nation often. Reagan, it is said, went over the heads of the Congress to go right to the people. He spoke directly. He spoke forcefully, and he could give people a sense that he was very much like them, only only their leader. Our current president, Barack Obama, certainly has shown the ability to communicate. Bill Clinton was a very good communicator. In fact, even George W Bush gave a speech on October or September 13th of 2001. That was a great speech, and he didn't do much after that.",624,"[-0.02593711 -0.00635764  0.00184592 ... -0.01778062 -0.01922229

Overall, this session provides a comprehensive overview of power, politics, and empowerment in organizations, offering valuable insights and strategies for understanding and utilizing them effectively.; Transcript: Welcome back. This will be our ninth session in ENMA 601 Analysis of Complex Organizations. This session is going to address a couple of topics that you may not be comfortable with. Many people are not, but it is a topic that's vitally important to engineering management, managers and leaders. It's the topic of power and politics. Every organization has a power structure. No matter whether it's hierarchical or linear or if it's virtual, there is a power structure based on certain types of characteristics of the people in the structure. There's also politics. Anytime you get more than one person together, you're going to have politics. Politics comes from the Greek word poly, which means the people. It is impossible to work in an organization and not have a certain degree of politics. The question to ask is not whether there's political behavior in the organization, but whether the behavior is focused on purposes that move the organization forward or cause the organization to fall into retreat. So we'll be looking at all of those issues today. And I believe you'll enjoy the session that we're about to embark on. As I mentioned, we'll be talking about power and politics in this session. This is our ninth session. We will be finishing up with future sessions and groups and teams managing performance. And our final session will be on leadership. Our objectives today are to look at some of the definitions of power, look at the relationship of power, authority and influence.",698,"[-0.01057061 -0.00934297  0.00154343 ... -0.0094722  -0.00024371

Politics in organizational enviroments,9.1,ACO,"Title: Politics in organizational enviroments; Description: In this video, the key takeaways center around the relationship between power and politics within organizations. It emphasizes that power and politics are closely connected, as the acquisition of power often involves political strategies. The unequal distribution of power is highlighted, with the importance of building coalitions to gain access to resources and protect individuals' interests in the organization. The amount of politics within an organization is said to be directly related to the scarcity and criticality of resources. Factors such as ambiguous decisions, indecisive leaders, and complex goals can lead to destructive politics. The impact of technology and external disruptions on power structures is also discussed. The video delves into the Machiavellian perspective of organizational politics, but offers an alternative view that politics can be a means of finding compromise and collaboration. Being involved in organizational politics is seen as crucial for success as a leader, and it recommends being aware of the political climate. Positive and negative political behaviors are differentiated, with positive behaviors including forming coalitions with positive aims and managing impressions. The video cautions against political activity that prioritizes personal agenda at the expense of the collective interest. Impression management techniques are discussed, as well as positive and negative aspects of power in organizations. Understanding power dynamics can help individuals recognize their own inadequacies and cope with change. However, negative behaviors such as avoiding action and scapegoating others can backfire. Strategies for managing resource dependencies within organizations and the importance of engaging in positive politics are highlighted. The video emphasizes the need for a governance structure and ethical basis in organizational practices. It stresses the importance of effective leadership, open communication, and ethical political behavior. It warns against falling into destructive practices and emphasizes fairness and privacy in decision-making. Overall, the video emphasizes the critical leadership skill of managing and acquiring power, understanding office politics, and using them positively for the benefit of the organization.; Transcript: We're back. I hope you enjoyed our discussion of power. Now we're going to embark on a discussion of politics. They're very closely intertwined. It's difficult to talk about power without talking about politics. The acquisition of power often depends on political strategies. A research named Nord suggests that there are four postulates of power that help focus on political realities. Coalitions and organizations compete for resources, and therefore, coalitions have to be built. If you're going to gain access to the resources of the organization. Coalitions are also created to protect the interests and the influences of individuals and actors in the organization. There's unequal distribution of power in the organization. You have to make sure that's not dehumanizing. But the exercise of power is certainly an important way to move an organization forward. So Nord looked at the construct of politics as very closely related to power in an organization. Power is also part of the social structure of an organization. So we have to understand that it is a normal and necessary thing in order to exercise power. So when we talk about political implications of power, there are several things that are really relevant. There's been a lot of research on this, thankfully, so we understand it pretty well. There's a direct relationship between the amount of politics and how critical and scarce the resources are. If an organization has abundance throughout, they have a lot of money. They're making money, their products are selling. There's no budget crisis. Then the the destructive politics in the organization are pretty low.

On the other hand, if things are really bad shape, that's when you see the destructive elements of politics kind of rear their head. Ambiguous decisions. Leaders that are indecisive tend to lead to more politics because people are jockeying for position. Ambiguous, complex goals that no one understands allows many people to use politics to get their way instead of transforming the organizational goals into their personal goals. So that's a bad thing. You want to make sure that the goals are clear and certainly technology in the external environment, the more disruption there is, the more change there is, the more likely that the power structures in the organization are going to be both active and possibly destructive. What our organizational politics? Well, there's a couple of issues. One is the Machiavellian point of view. Machiavelli wrote in The Prince, which is well worth reading. A guide for leaders to move their their constituencies forward and had a lot to do with self-interest, finding ways that you could be more feared than loved, but making sure that you always were pushing the right levers to get things done irrespective of what the outcomes might be. Now, Machiavelli has gotten some reasonably bad press over the methods. Frankly, we have adopted most of Machiavelli's organizational politics methods or political methods in our modern politics. In fact, we've even transcended Machiavelli in some ways. So organizational politics in the Machiavellian sense are defined as the management of influence to obtain the ends not sanctioned by the organization.

In other words, trying to get the what get your way, even though the organization might not agree. And being ready to use sanctioned ends through non sanctioned means to get things done. So it's either to get something done that the organization doesn't agree with or to use a method that the organization doesn't agree with to get an end that the organization does agree with. So each of those would be considered by Machiavelli the proper use of politics. Other definitions include activities taken within the organization to acquire, develop and use power and other resources to get a preferred outcome. Now, in this case, we want the organizational outcomes to be positive for the organization, not just for one individual. But that's not always true in politics. Sometimes in organizations is used to the benefit of 1 or 2 people or a small group or the leadership only. A good example of this would be where leaders are laying off tens of thousands of people and also voting themselves huge bonuses. That sends a bad message to everyone. And in a contracting environment. Leaders ought to sacrifice along with the people. Rarely do they do that in organizations, though. An alternative view that I would like you to think about it. Is that a necessary function resulting from the fact that all of us are different? All of us have different self interests and it's very, very difficult to get people marching to the same tune in an organization.

It can be the art of creative compromise or collaboration among competing interests. If you can get people who have different views to come together and to actually believe in a single solution, then you've done a very powerful thing. It's also the use of power is to do things, ends and means that are socially acceptable to balance both the individual and the collective interest. All of these would be an alternative and a positive, more positive view of politics than the Machiavellian view. I often run across this situation in in many organizations. I want to be a leader. I want to get that promotion. But I don't really get involved in organizational politics. Well, that's an oxymoron. If you're going to be a leader, you're going to be involved in politics. Now you may be the player or you may be the played, and that decision is up to you. If you don't like politics, you're not going to be a leader. And if you don't like politics and you refuse to play them. Now, I'm not saying on the negative end, but you've got to get involved in political activities if you're going to be successful in an organization. Reality is there's political behavior in every organization. It's not all bad politics for members has has to do with people getting people together, working toward a common good. You've got to be involved in the politics. If you're going to succeed, you've got to be aware of the political climate and the organization, what moves people.

Some of the things we've talked about when we talked about power, as you progress up the ladder, you'll never get to be the head of an organization, even if you don't exercise some political behavior and political influence. Now, negative political behaviors such as attacking other people, blaming others, controlling information, forming negative coalitions to fight other people, are all going to be things that aren't going to serve you well if you use positive implications of political activity. Political activity. Such as forming coalitions with people that have positive aims in mind. Networking, as we mentioned, to reach out to other people, creating obligations that I talked about in the influence part of our discussion and managing the impressions of the organization. All of those can be positive ways of creating good political will. Now you can you can use all of these in negative ways, too, no question about that. But as long as your aims and your means are are done with with the proper reverence for positive outcomes, for ethics, for caring about both the collective and the individual and balancing that, then your political activity is probably going to be seen as appropriate. The minute you start caring about only your own agenda or only moving yourself forward, that's when politics begins to take on a negative context. A part of of politics that is really interesting, I find is this whole concept of impression management.

Once again, you can go overboard with this, too. You can go overboard with anything. But but some some people tend to want to be more impressive than others. So they pay great attention to the way they look. They dress appropriately. They they follow what the organizational mores. If the boss wears a red tie, they wear a red tie. Some of that is a little bit of an overkill. But there are impression management techniques that are not negative. Some of these high self monitors, in other words, people that pay close attention to their own appearance tend to engage more in impression management than others. But having a clean uniform, showing up on time, being reliable, all of those are are types of impression management that are positive. Some other things that we can do that are have both positive and negative connotations. For example, conformity and conformity could mean there's a dress code. We're going to wear a certain uniform today. Impression management, if it's used properly, can be always have the right uniform, always have it clean, always have the brass polished. That's conformity. Also, a negative side of conformity is just agreeing with people who are powerful, whether you whether you really agree or not. Just making it seem like you agree and flattering them, giving them flattery about everything that they do. Making excuses is a form of impression management to. Anytime things go wrong, it's never your fault. There was traffic or someone else didn't deliver things.

Apologies are very similar to excuses and that they're admitting responsibility and asking for forgiveness. Acclamations are explaining favorable events. So we also call this spin making it look like you had a bigger role than you did. Flattery, of course, is complimenting others not because it's sincere, but because you're trying to impress them. Doing favors for the purpose of doing favors and creating IOUs. Very different than what we talked about earlier. Doing something nice to gain somebody's approval. When the sole purpose of doing the nice thing is for approval, not because it was the right thing to do, and also associating with people that are powerful just so you can create the image that you have, that you have referent power. All of these are sometimes impression management techniques that that can be used to good or used to not so good. And it depends on our means and our ends when we engage in these. Some of the positive aspects of power. If we are powerful in the organization, we may have some inadequacies or deficits that other people can fill. Using power correctly can help the organization and help us cope with change. Because it is it gives a wide extension of your personality to others. If people believe in you as a leader and you don't have to be in a position of authority on the org chart to exercise power. Some of the most powerful people I've ever met don't even show up on the org chart.

There are people, people that the leaders consult. There are people that have expert power or relationship power and they are sought out for their counsel and for their for their wisdom. So you don't have to be at the top of the organization chart or even in a big box to have a great deal of power in an organization. Sometimes that's the most powerful kind of influence to have. What we sometimes see in organizations is that people engage in what we call self-protection strategies to what they think will consolidate or enhance their power. Generally, this backfires on them when they avoid taking action or risk taking risks because they're afraid that something could go wrong and that generally rebounds to a bad effect on them when they refuse to take responsibility or accountability. That generally has. A negative effect or when they defend their own turf. For example, when we look at avoiding action or risking risking risk taking. Some leaders, when they get into a situation where they're uncomfortable, will make sure that we follow every rule in the book that that we don't skip a certain. Any rule Sometimes you just play dumb like they don't know or they do. The situation, they could stall. They could have routine stalling or very creative stalling when they don't want to make a decision because of the risk that they perceive. When we look at redirecting accountability or passing the buck, that is a way of redirecting accountability.

They could rewrite history so that they're not seen as having any responsibility. They could scapegoat another person. They could blame the problem on an unaccountable risk. So I was with an organization once that never met their goals, and they always blamed it on fluctuating fluctuating currencies, foreign currencies, and they could also escalate commitment, which is to continue to do the same things even though things aren't going well. And finally, they could be in a position where they start depending their defending their turf, expanding their jobs to make their their organization more more important, or forming coalitions to defend their turf. All of these can be self-protection strategies and aren't always positive, mostly negative. Now, when you see the executives, they are some of the greatest example of politics takes place in the executive suites with the CFO and the chief executive officer and all those high paid, highly ranked people. Sometimes there are resource dependencies and that explains it. When we talk about resource dependencies, that's when resources are scarce. People, money, time. Sometimes outsiders come in a venture capitalists or people like that that have money to lend and they're given control because the executives want more money or more capital infused into the organization, or if there just aren't many substitutes for a resource and they need to go out and get resources, one department needs resources, the other has it. You might see political behavior or manifest its head in in a very negative light.

Strategies for managing this resource dependencies is once again working, developing compromises across the organization. These are the positive politics that we can engage in altering the firms. In other words, finding another type of resource if you're if you're using oil to run your factories and it's expensive and hard to get. Think about changing over or propose changing over to natural gas, which is more abundant. Redefining how the firm is going to conduct business in an international arena. If if you're in a market that is that is not paying off for you, get out of the market, get into another market. And executive pay tends to be an area fraught with politics in in most organizations, public organizations anyway. Now, strategic use of politics. There's a growing awareness of of being involved. If you're a US corporation, getting involved with electoral politics, making sure that you're engaging with the politicians. Microsoft doesn't learn this lesson. In the 1990s and early 2000 when the government came after them for antitrust violations and Microsoft tended to just ignore it. And when they found out that the government had real teeth and the real ability to punish them, they became very political, very fast. And they've learned their lesson very quickly. But you cannot escape the the electoral politics. So many industries like the auto industry, has turned to the government to protect them from competition. But it's important as an organization at the executive level to decide when you're going to get involved in this political process because you could be involved with the ends.

And the party that's in power and you could be supporting them and that party could get voted out of power and then you could be in trouble. So if you're putting all your eggs in the basket of politics, that could be very, very dangerous and and painful for the long run. We talk about organizational governance. We're talking about how an organization manages the politics and manages the managerial behavior. This has gotten a lot of attention in the last decade or so because of the mismanagement that we've seen and the downright fraud and exercise of of some terrible practices in many organizations. What we want to make sure is that we have a governance structure in place, in an organization, so that our daily practices as leaders in an organization are subject to openness, are subject to scrutiny, so that we can't be in the practice or the habit of doing what we want for our own good. It's got to be for the good of your organization's good, for the good of the organization. Some US corporations have have been wildly out of control. Most, however, are not. So governance involves everybody in the organization that's in a leadership position as well as the employees, and there has to be an ethical basis to it. We've talked about Sarbanes-Oxley and and in previous sessions and and the importance of making sure that the things that the organization is doing are both legal, ethical and serve the greater good of the organization, not just a few people in the organization.

We often see that political behavior versus rational behavior can rear its ugly head if the organization is threatened, if the status quo is threatened. A new technology might come in, a new threat might arise. And often what we see is as the as the stress sometimes get higher, gets higher, so does the degree of political behavior, negative political behavior. Some of the things that can cause that status quo to be threatened are we're dependent on a resource and it becomes very scarce. Once again, ambiguous decisions or goals, changes in technology or organizations can threaten the status quo. And finally, one of the some some advice I would give as a person who has been a player in organizational politics and a holder and both a follower of power, if you want to be an effective leader, if you want to make sure that you're using power and politics appropriately, make sure that you're always in connection with with 360 degree, both your the the people you lead, your peers and your supervisors. Make sure that you're the role model for doing ethical, non destructive political behaviors. Don't be afraid to exercise power, but make sure it's ethical and you follow the rules of it's for the greater good and it's a balance of the collective needs being met and the individual needs. Be wary of people who suck up to you and and appear to be only acting in their own self interest, both peers and subordinates and bosses for that matter.

Make sure that people's privacy respected is respected and always ask the question when you're about to make a decision, Is this fair? Would I like it if this was done to me? And if the answer is no, don't do it. Finally, to summarize, we've talked about power managing and acquiring it as a critical leadership skill. You won't get very far if you don't. You're not good at both politics and the acquisition and management of power. You cannot avoid office politics, but you can manage it positively and use it for the good of the organization. Know who your allies are. Know who your adversaries are. Focus on the mission is normally a superior political approach. As long as you don't spin it out of control. And don't let the ends justify the means, that can be a very destructive thing. Our next session, please read Chapter 11 groups and teams and complete the homework assignment for Module nine before you attempt the next session. I've enjoyed our session today on power and politics. I hope you've learned some of the proper applications of power and some of the proper uses of politics. Remember, you can't escape it, so it is best to learn how to use it appropriately. With that said, I'm very anxiously looking forward to our next session together when we will talk about groups and teams.

impact of teams in organizations,10.1,ACO,"Title: impact of teams in organizations; Description: In this video, the instructor discusses the importance and impact of teams in organizations. They share their personal experiences of being on both exceptional and dysfunctional teams, emphasizing how the quality of a team can greatly affect job satisfaction. The instructor then introduces the concept of self-managed teams and highlights their potential benefits for organizations in fast-paced environments where quick and accurate decision-making is crucial. The characteristics of successful self-managed teams are discussed, including control over team member selection, clarity on purpose and goals, team identity, self-regulation, and fairness. The instructor provides the example of Harley Davidson's self-managed teams as a success story. The Harley Davidson teams are described as highly trained, motivated, and productive groups, responsible for completing a motorcycle as a team rather than on an assembly line. The stages of transition to self-managed teams are outlined, including the initial announcement of difficulties, challenges during the adaptation period, the emergence of leaders within the teams, the development of team cohesiveness, and the ultimate achievement of self-management. The instructor emphasizes the crucial role of leadership support and active communication in the success of self-managed teams. The video concludes by highlighting the importance of teams in organizations and previewing the next session on performance management. Overall, the video provides insights into the benefits, challenges, and successful implementation of self-managed teams in complex organizations.; Transcript: Welcome back. I hope you had a chance to think about some good teams that you've been on and some teams that maybe weren't so good. I can tell you throughout my experience in organizations, I've had quite a few teams that were really exceptional. And from a personal point of view, when when you're working on a team that's that's synergistic, that's creative, that has the ability to make some decisions on its own, It's a very pleasurable experience. You really almost can't wait to get back together with the team. On the other hand, I've been on some teams that really weren't very good at all dysfunctional, a lot of backstabbing, some some bad karma between the team members. And those are the things where you want to you feel like avoiding every meeting. You dread the meetings that are coming up so it really can have the type of team that you're on, if it's a good team, can affect your satisfaction. But at work. But if it's a bad team can profoundly affect the way you feel about work. Let's wrap up this session by talking about a very special kind of team that is becoming more and more evident. There are some really good self managed teams in the workplace, some that aren't as good and often don't last as long. But the really good self managed teams can be a real benefit to the organization as fast moving as society is today. Decisions need to be made very rapidly and they need to be accurate.

Almost all of the time. If you're in an organization where every decision has to be made at the top by the commanding officer or the boss or the CEO, that's a an organization that's going to move very slowly. If you're working in an organization where people know their roles, they're confident, they're willing, they're in, That's four stage that we talked about, then you can make decisions very, very quickly that can be the right decisions and you can stay ahead of the game and be very productive. So let's talk about those self managed teams and I'll give you an example of a real life self managed team or a set of self managed teams. What are some of the characteristics? Well, first of all, the true self managed team is going to have some control over the people on the team. They are. They get to either hire or select the team members and they might be able to, in occasion be able to move a team member off if the team member is not performing now. They really must have clarity and agreement on the purpose and the goals that they're achieving. They have to share those, and if they don't, they're not going to be a very good self managed team because remember, they're going to have autonomy over almost everything. They have an identity as a team. They feel like they're an important group.

They regulate themselves and there's an extreme amount of fairness in the team. One example of a self managed team that actually saved an American iconic corporation is the self managed teams at Harley Davidson. So let's take a look at the Harley Davidson in Milwaukee. Let's take a look at some information that came from the University of Wisconsin about how these self managed teams work at at Harley Davidson. They are highly trained, highly motivated, very high performing group of people from 6 to 18 people. The 18 people are really not part of the self managed team. They tend to keep them at about six and it's their responsibility to turn out a finished motorcycle or other piece of work. It's not an assembly line like like you might think about where people don't communicate and they just one person puts a rivet in the other puts a door on. This is a group of people working together to create a motorcycle one one team per motorcycle. And Harley Davidson has evolved over this over time through a series of processes. Some of the things that have really helped out and have really helped Harley is the fact that they people cross train, the employees, cross train. They often do this voluntarily so that they'll know every job on the team. You may be the engine person or the the drivetrain person, but you're going to know something about the engine.

If you're the drivetrain person, you're going to know something about the drivetrain. If you're the engine person, they communicate very rapidly and very effectively. The organization is very flat. They don't have very many layers of management, like many organizations that are in productivity. And when they began the they went through some difficulties that we will talk about getting to self managed teams, but their productivity gains were astounding after only 18 months. And that holds true for most companies that genuinely take on this concept of self managed teams and and do it right. So that's the benefits for Harley. What's the benefits for the employee? Well, they don't get stuck putting the same door on the same model of car for the rest of their lives. They're doing a lot of different things. They're working in harmony with the group. It's not an assembly line. It's more of a group function. They have a lot of what we call job enrichment, a lot of input into what goes on on the team. They're responsible for the outcome. They know it and they're proud of it. They learn a lot. They take on more skills than they would in just a normal assembly line. And they really, really do care about not only the machine that they're building, but these people are devoted and dedicated to Harley. They are really advocates of the Harley Davidson Corporation. Let's see how they transform themselves, because the the stages that they went through came about because Harley was having a very difficult time making it in the in the marketplace.

They were certainly having a difficult time selling motorcycles. Their motorcycles weren't very good. And the brand name was still very popular when they began this excursion into self-managed teams. They saw the leaders saw that there weren't they weren't going to be able to maintain this brand identification very long if they if they kept turning out expensive products that weren't very good. So one of the things that that they invested in was training, first of all, technical training to make sure that people on the teams knew their jobs and knew all of the skill sets that went into creating a motorcycle, not just a primary job. Second is if you're going to have a self-managed team, the team has to learn to do the administrative functions reporting, monitoring, hiring, firing, compensation. All of that has to be done within the team and it's got to be done right. You don't you don't give up on the employment laws just because you're a self-managed team. And finally, and maybe the most difficult was the interpersonal skills, getting people to be more effective, to show emotional intelligence in order to make the team as effective and efficient as possible. Now, let's look at the stages that that Harley went through. First of all, they announced to the organization that there were difficulties. The manager says the CEO and the other top managers said to to everybody in the company, we are headed for bankruptcy and we may go out of business if we don't change the way we do things.

So they created this burning platform of survival and got everybody convinced and pretty much understanding that if they didn't do something radically different, that Harley was not going to be around very much longer. So everybody was invested in changing things. So the management team got together, put some strategies in place. They started the training and everybody was on board. Well, that lasted for a while until the realities began to hit and people began to see that this was different than the way they were doing it. This was different than the assembly line, and they were having difficulties making this transition. Now, in any time that you try to do something different, you're not going to be as good as you were previously at doing the previous thing. Now this is natural and normal. However, if the managers and the leaders don't tell you to expect this, you maybe think that you're failing and you may think it's easy. Let's go back to the way we did it, because I knew how to do that. I don't know how to do this new thing, this self managed team. And there are a few, more than a few people that hope that fail would fail. So we could go back to the old way of doing business.

This is a normal stage two. Luckily, Harley managers were aware of these stages. They'd studied self management and they knew what to do about it. They stuck with it, but they communicated all the time during stage two that we are expecting things to get better, b get worse before they get better. So when you when you feel like you don't know what you're doing, you feel like you're having trouble adapting, that's normal. But when you when you come out of this and it became becomes more natural to you, we're going to be a lot more productive. And people did believe that because managers communicated so readily. The next. The transition continued as the leaders emerged on these. These self managed teams, people began to actually learn the skills involved, the interpersonal skills in particular, and they began to see progress. So one person typically would step forward as the informal leader of the person that had the the expert power or the personality power. And the this is where the production begins to really increase dramatically. Stage four is where the teams begin to get really cohesive. We talked about cohesiveness. This is where they're really working well together. Everybody is in a sense of of of flow. They know their job. They're enjoying it. They're learning. They're helping one another. They're sharing. This is a very positive part of the transition. And finally, they actually come to the stage where they are a self managed team.

They are mature. They're developing this commitment to the not only team goals, but the corporate goals. They take on an identity of a team and they are really humming. And that's the way Harley is today. So let's take a little closer look at Harley. 1983. They were having a very difficult time. The sales were dropping, the employee morale was bad. The motorcycles weren't being they weren't very reliable and they were in a lot of debt. Harley was in big trouble and they were going to be either sold or they were going to be disbanded or something was going to happen. And the CEO and the managers understood that. So the management come up, came up with three guidelines. First of all, they realized this is not something we're going to fix in 90 days. It's going to take some time. It's going to take some effort and it's going to take some patience. They also recognize that leadership is not just a single person in the organization that has super powers, but it's a process. And they want everybody to take on the mantle of leadership for making the organization better. They also realized very early on that people are your only real sustainable competitive advantage and you might have great technology, you might have a great factory, but if you don't have your people energized, then you're probably going to have a very difficult time competing.

What did they do that was that was different? Well, they saw that the people were involved. They were they did care about the future of the company and they were willing to accept this change, at least initially, until they could see what it was going to happen. The transition that Harley went through had the full support of everybody in upper management. The upper management, the seat from the CEO on down. Was effusive in their discussion of what they were going to do. The importance of it and the effects that they expected. Now, when those things began to come true, the credibility of the upper management became much more stronger in Harley, and people began to realize that the self managed team thing was really working. Finally, the upper management was willing to let things take their course and not pull the plug on this before the success was reached. It's amazing. Amazing how close many organizations are to success when they pull the plug. It persistence. Sticking with a good idea over time is often the best way to achieve rapid success. And it sounds like an oxymoron, but it's not. If you stay with an idea and it's a good idea through the tough times, you're going to come out the other end much better off usually. But you've got to stick with it and you can't pull the plug when things become just a little bit dicey.

Finally, let's look at the results and you can see if you had invested $100 in Harley-Davidson in 1986 and come forward to 2006, 2007, 2008, you would see that you would have had about. $22,000 in 2007, although the market value has gone down a little bit because of the overall market. But you can see that that the their their efforts at self-managed teams really paid off. It's a very powerful thing. So it's a lesson that we can learn. One of the primary lessons I think we can learn from this is that the not only management support, but active leadership of these types of initiatives are incredibly important. If they're going to ever get off the ground, the leaders have to be obvious. They have to be regularly communicating both the benefits and the trials. And finally, they've got to have the patience to stick with it. We've talked about teams being a vital part of any organization. It's a modern paradigm that teams are what we naturally organize around. Teams do need good leadership and they do need to know what their boundaries are. Empowerment is one thing. We've talked about the conditions of empowerment. But the team has to be both willing and able before they can be empowered. Each team has to be judged on their capabilities and willingness. We're seeing a lot more virtual teams, so we need to get used to it and get good at it because it's not going away.

It's just too powerful. It's something that's too important and highly productive when we do it right. We see that self managed teams can be very powerful, but the organization really has to commit them. Commit to self managed teams if they're going to work. We have completed our discussion of teams and and self managed teams and group performance. In this session next session, we will talk about the management aspects of behavioral performance management. Job design Goal setting. So in preparation for the next module, please do the homework assignment for module ten. And read chapters 11 and 12, and we'll discuss the elements of managing performance in the workplace. We've talked about teams and groups. They are such an important part of our work life and organizational life. It's important to understand the elements of group dynamics, the elements of team dynamics, and to make sure that when we put a team together. That we're doing it deliberately and thoughtfully. And we're not just assembling people because they're the ones that are left over with nothing to do. If we're going to use self managed teams, it takes a lot of discipline and a lot of planning to be successful. I've enjoyed this discussion with you in this session. It's a very important part of our organizational life, and I'm looking forward to our next meeting when we talk about how to manage performance in an organization. So until then, I'm signing off.",3485,"[-0.03351564 -0.01449893  0.01347455 ... -0.01562837 -0.00273989

Managing Performance,11.0,ACO,"Title: Managing Performance; Description: In this video transcript, the instructor highlights the importance of managing performance and job design in complex organizations. The key takeaways include the significance of job characteristics such as variety, identity, and significance for employee motivation, and the added benefits of autonomy and feedback. The instructor also emphasizes the importance of cross-training to avoid single points of failure in critical tasks, and the positive impact of autonomy in decision-making and feedback for employee accountability and improvement. The video emphasizes the importance of creating a work environment that values job characteristics, autonomy, feedback, engagement, and supportive supervision to enhance employee motivation and performance. Additionally, the video discusses the impact of the social context of the work environment on individuals' attitudes and behaviors, and emphasizes the importance of addressing conflicts and problems collectively rather than blaming individuals. The video also mentions the sociotechnical approach to work and organizational design, and the role of high-performance work practices in optimizing creativity, performance, and empowerment. Overall, the key takeaways highlight the importance of effectively managing performance and job design to enhance motivation, work satisfaction, and overall organizational success.; Transcript: Welcome back to our 11th session of ENMA 601 Analysis of Complex Organizations. Today we're going to be talking about a very important topic in the context of engineering management, and that's managing performance. We're going to take a look at it from about three different perspectives. We're going to look at learning. We're going to look at the whole concept of positive reinforcement or reinforcement in and of itself. And then we're going to look at how we use positive discipline in those cases where we really need to to sort of bring down the hammer when when an employee is certainly or a colleague is not doing what they should be doing. This is an important topic. And one of the reasons it's important is because it's done so poorly and done so infrequently. And many organizations in America, poor performance is ignored. In some cases it's even rewarded. And we'll talk about how it's rewarded when we talk about reinforcement. And many organizations and many leaders are unpracticed at using the concepts of managing performance that we're going to talk about today. This is a very important tool to have in your repertoire, in your tool bag, as a leader, as a manager. One of the reasons is if you've got a person on your team that's not performing, you have more than one problem. If you don't address it, if you do not address the lack of performance by an individual, eventually other people are going to notice.",522,"[-0.04243008  0.00536643  0.01744172 ... -0.01002041  0.00433404

Course Wrap-up,13.0,ACO,"Title: Course Wrap-up; Description: In this video, the instructor discusses the importance of leadership development within organizations. They highlight the skills and competencies necessary for future leaders, including strategy, managing change, building relationships, developing talent, cognitive ability, big-picture thinking, objective decision-making, and effective communication. The video emphasizes the need to practice leadership for about 10,000 hours and suggests various ways to learn and develop leadership skills, such as enrolling in courses, studying role models, networking, finding mentors, making mistakes, and observing and learning from both good and bad leaders. The video also discusses research findings that intentional leadership development efforts yield better outcomes for organizations, using General Electric as an example. Experiential learning is emphasized as valuable for emerging leaders. The video highlights the importance of selecting the right leaders, evaluating their performance and style, and tailoring individualized leadership development programs. It introduces the Leadership Challenge approach, based on research by Kouzes and Posner, which emphasizes five general practices of exemplary leadership. The characteristics of successful leaders, such as honesty, forward-thinking, inspiring, and competence, are discussed. The video stresses the significance of challenging established practices, enabling others to act, recognizing achievements, and fostering a culture of innovation within organizations. Adaptation and interpersonal skills are emphasized as crucial in leadership roles. The importance of further reading and continuous learning in leadership is also mentioned. Overall, the video highlights the essentials for developing effective leaders in organizations and the importance of continuous improvement as an engineering manager.; Transcript: If you remember, we started this session on leadership by asking the question, Are leaders born or are they made? And we determine, based on our experiences and the work of Warren Bennis, that they they can be made. Well, having said that, what are organizations doing about developing their leaders? Well, it's a very interesting situation that we find ourselves in because our next topic of discussion is leadership. Development Conference Board did some work in this area, very extensive work, and they've written several reports. In 97, they did a report and they followed up in 2001 and they've been following up on a regular basis 97. They saw that nearly half of the organizations they talked to responded by saying their leadership strength was either excellent or good. But by 2001, that's four years later, that number dropped to a third. The interesting part about this is less than one half of the organizations are really doing anything about developing their future leaders. Now, this is astounding because they recognize the importance of leadership, but they're not doing anything about it. And this is a this is probably our next great crisis that we're going to face in in our society is where are our leaders going to come from? Where are they going to get the training and development? When baby boomers start retiring, have we prepared people to take over those leadership positions? Now, I for one, believe that my generation of baby boomers have hasn't done a really great job of leadership, but they do have some experiences that are useful.

The skills and competencies that the Leader the Conference Board says are going to be necessary are things like strategy, managing change, building relationships and developing talent, the very things that seem to be missing in today's society. So their their report tends to be prophetic. What skills do they believe as as experts in leadership are going to be needed and needed just next year? Cognitive ability, the ability to make plans and goals and stick with them. The ability to think big picture in long term, the ability to analyze information objectively, rationally, unemotionally and to make good decisions and finally to communicate those decisions. Influence and persuasion is important. Managing diversity and managing things like globalization. Delegating. Adapting and once more, finding and developing talent. Now, these are the things we've been talking about in this session and really throughout this course as being important elements of leadership. How do you learn to be a leader? Well, it is it is time consuming. Much of the research indicates that if you want to be an expert at something, you have to practice it for 10,000 hours. That's about five years of full time, eight hour a day work. One of the ways that you can get some tips or by what you're doing right now, which is go to enroll in a course and learn through training and education. That's not where it ends. And if that's where it ends, you're probably not going to be very successful.

Find role models. They don't have to be people, you know, It's good if they are people, you know. But look at people in industry, in politics, in the military that you admire. Study them, see what they do to be effective leaders. Now, there's plenty of great literature. In fact, I'm going to give you a list of books to read. They're not required. They're for your own edification, do some research. Old Dominion has a great online library. There's lots of research available. Read any book by Warren Bennis and you'll learn something about research. Get engaged in networking. The more you network, the more people you know, the better off you're going to be. And there's lots of great social networking tools. Get a mentor, somebody that's respected, that's not in your immediate chain of command, somebody who's willing to give you advice and finally get out there and make some mistakes, screw up and learn from it. And that's one of the best ways to learn how to be a leader. Also, pay attention to those leaders who are doing a very bad job and resolve that you'll never do the kinds of things that they do. Some research findings in looking at the development of leaders is that when organizations focus on leadership development intentionally and not randomly, they tend to have a much better results in outcomes. So you can learn different things from different experiences and great organizations.

General Electric has one of the best leadership development approaches of anyone. They're very deliberate and they realize that there's a lot of dimensions to leadership development. As we talked about earlier, the challenge in an experience is very important, and that drives the learning almost as much as the the achievement, the fact that when you give an emerging leader a very difficult task with very little resources and very little help and you watch them struggle through it, that challenge can be really, really a good lesson for that leader to learn. Experiential lessons have a lot more staying power than book lessons that make sense, and it can affect the way that you lead some some experience from the research done by AT&T shows that the leader that you have on the first day on the job is going to have a big impact on the way that you lead in the future and also giving people a different a variety of experiences. Don't let them get in a rut. Don't let them If they're going to be leaders, they've got to be wider than just one particular area of expertise. When we see the research that's done on really admired leaders and admired organizations, we see that the great organizations really do focus on leadership development. They have assessments that develop, that they develop or they use that have been developed to make sure that they are selecting the right leaders. They are constantly evaluating the leader's performance, the leader's style.

They have individualized leadership development programs that are tailored to the individual needs, not one size fits all. They make sure that that the leaders are people centered and they emphasize things like self confidence, self control, achievement, empathy. They all look like strong components of emotional intelligence to me. So in the in the realm of leadership development, we tend to see that the organizations that intentionally focus on leadership development, that have a path laid out, that that focus on the individual needs of the individual leader tend to be more successful than those who do it halfheartedly. I now like to talk about a process and an approach based on some some research in the last 25 years that has been very, very effective. It's called the Leadership Challenge from a book of the same name. The research done by the authors Kouzes and Posner is well summarized in the book. It's a very accessible, very readable book. And I if you decide to to read it or pick it up, I think it will be to your benefit as a leader. Let's talk about some of the elements and the development of this leadership challenge. Kouzes and Posner have been working together for a very long time. Barry Posner is on the left. He's the the dean of the Santa Clara University's Levy School of Management. Kouzes worked side by side with him. He's he's a professor of leadership at that same university.

They have both received numerous awards for their writing, for for their education abilities. And the Leadership Challenge is a business book that has sold over a million copies. They also have created something called the Leadership Practices Inventory. I use that in my leadership courses and it is the most reliable and up to date instrument available today. If you have an opportunity at some point to engage in the leadership practice inventory, it'll tell you about a lot about your leadership styles. Now they have, as I mentioned, they've been an award winning set of researchers, and I strongly believe in the work that they have done. They began with a research project by Kouzes and Posner back in 1983. That's such a long time ago. They wanted to find out what people's personal, best experiences was all about. And they looked at everybody. They didn't just look at the organizational stars. They looked at the average, everyday person. They wanted to know what people did when they were at their personal best in leading others. So they looked at these patterns of success. That was a four year project, and they found that there were five general practices of exemplary leadership. And then they developed this leadership practices inventory that has been validated over time to show essentially what the. You know what the important practice measure the important practices and make sure that the individuals have a really good sense of what's important and what's not.

They talk to a bunch of people, hundreds of people, and since thousands more, they started out in 87, they did more than 450 surveys to to look at questions like when did you really feel like your personal best leadership was exhibited? Who started the project? Who prepared you for the experience? What techniques and strategies did you use? What did you learn about leadership? And they documented all those and they began to see some commonalities between people that they began to focus on. At the same time, they developed a shorter, more of a two page survey. They ran it through 80 managers, and then they did 42 additional in-depth interviews. They began to look at middle and senior level managers in both private and public sector. Then they went into do more and more research based on these foundational principles. Their coverage began to look at community leaders, student leaders, church leaders, government leaders, not just business leaders and lots of people that weren't leaders. They were non managers, but they could comment on what leaders had done. Each person they spoke to had at least one leadership story to tell stories that didn't sound like what you read in the textbooks for leadership and management. And they weren't the the functions of management, planning, organizing, staffing, directing and control. There were more about what was going on dynamically, what actions were people taking, how did they motivate the people, how did they improve things in the organization? All of those kinds of things were subjects that that Kouzes and Posner looked into.

What they looked at or characteristics, and they said, what are the characteristics that you think are most important and why are they so important? And they've done this survey. Not only did they do it in 1987, they've done it in subsequent years, 95, 2002 and 2007, oddly enough, maybe, maybe not. So oddly, they found that honesty. Rates number one across time from 1987 to 2007, a 20 year period. And not by a little bit by a lot. Almost 90% of the people across that time said that the most important characteristic of a leader is, to be honest. Now you can pick more than one. They pick the top seven. That's why when you add all these up, you're going to see that it's more than 100%. Now, they looked at the US. They looked at North America, South America, Africa. A majority for the US. But they're there across the world. So the four top characteristics were honesty, forward looking, inspiring and competent. These were the top things that were considered to be most important by leaders in the work that Kouzes and Posner have done. They also looked across to when we look at that same survey, we see that other things were included, intelligence ranks right about in the middle. Fair mindedness, not as high as you might think. Determine. And let's go to the bottom of the list, the 15 to 20 loyal.

Loyalty wasn't seen as a characteristic that they admired that much. Independence wasn't that important, but honesty, forward looking competence, those kinds of things are what are seen as the most important inspiring. The ability to aspire, inspire us to do great things, the ability to look forward into the future and tell us what it looks like, the honesty that they exhibit in their competence. So with that, let's set the foundation for the Five Practices of Exemplary leadership. They went through this personal best experience and they began to collect stories and they begin to see that there are important. Distinctions between the people that have had great experiences and those that have not and their leadership practices. Inventory is based on this. So let's begin with the discussion of these five practices. Koji is Posners say that the leadership is the art of mobilizing others to want to struggle for shared aspiration. Now, there's a couple of key words in here. First of all, mobilizing, getting people to act, getting people energized, to want to struggle. It's not to want to do the easy thing. It's to want to challenge themselves, to do things that are shared among them. Now, the five practices that they have discovered, they have they have cleverly named the model the way inspire a shared vision, challenge the process, enable others to act and encourage the heart. Now, we won't have time to go in excruciating detail on each one of these, but I think I'll give you enough of an impetus to go maybe study this a little bit more because it is such a powerful model.

Let's look at the first element or the first practice, which is modeling the way. Modeling the way simply means you articulate who you are and what you believe in, and you live your life by those models. If you think about clarifying what you believe in and talking about it, many leaders have strong beliefs and strong principles, but they don't always talk about it. You need to talk about what's important to you and you need to make sure that what you do is consistent with what you say you believe in. Now, can you think of anyone, a leader who might be that way, a person that you clearly know what they stand for and their actions are consistent with what they say? If you do, you may have a leader who is modeling the way. Ralph Waldo Emerson said it best. I think don't say things which you say stands over you the while and thunder what you are stands over you the while and thunder so that I cannot hear what you say to the contrary. In other words, what Emerson is saying is modeling the way is important because it doesn't matter what you say. If what you say is not consistent with who you are. So when you are. And what you do. Are consistent.

That's very powerful leadership characteristic. Inspire a shared vision without a vision that people will perish. Isaiah says. It's the idea of looking into the future and finding these exciting imagining and articulating these exciting and ennobling possibilities. Telling people that the organization can do great things that will be exciting, and then getting other people to share that vision. So there's two parts of this that's very important. Have you known leaders that have done this? I certainly have, and they have been some of the best leaders I've known. Teddy Roosevelt said it really well. I think when it comes to challenging the process, he says it's far better to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs. Even though checkered by failure than to take the rank of those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much because they live in the gray twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat. Roosevelt was. Teddy Roosevelt was quite the philosopher and has written extensively about it. So what Roosevelt is really talking about is challenging the process. Great leaders are pioneers. They continually seek seek out new ways to do things, new opportunities to improve. They are agents of change. They want to treat every job as an adventure. It's like it's like Lewis and Clark. Every job is an unexplored wilderness. If leaders want to inspire the best in others, they must find and create opportunities for people to do great things, to outdo themselves, to explore new grounds. This is one of the reasons that Apple is so successful is because their people are always doing and trying new things.

Furthermore, they've got to make responsibilities enjoyable, exciting, make a risk taking an adventure that that is rewarding. Not every risk pays off, but the worst risks you can take is to take no risks. Humor is turns out to be very important in this, too. Researchers have found that humor can lead to cohesion and bonding between team members, especially if it's directed by the leader at the leader. Treat every assignment as a way to improve the organization. Look at the organization is even if it's good. Is there a way to make it better? Look for talent. Look for people who are willing to take risks. As I said earlier, you've got a lot of genius in your organization. Make it your job to unlock that genius. Leaders are those who see opportunities everywhere, even when things are not good. But especially in their own people, they see the ability to develop and lead. Those people question the status quo and kill the sacred cows. They are Every organization is going to have sacred cows. You might not be popular if you do this, but you've got to go after them if they're causing the organization to perform at less than an optimal level, then the way we've always done it, it's not going to be good enough. Wise is the way we've always done it. Why is this a good way to do it and harvest new ideas? Find out ways that you can do things differently both inside and outside the organization.

Now, organizations are often resistant to change, and when I run into a change resistant organization, I'm. I think about the the story of the Christmas ham. And this is a story about a young woman who has just been married and she's cooking dinner for the family with her husband's, helping her prepare, and they're going to cook a ham for Christmas. So her husband goes out being the dutiful husband, buys a big ham and brings it home. And her instructions to him are, you have to take a saw and cut off the last several inches of the ham, the butt end of the ham. There's a bone there. And being a curious newlywed, the husband says, I'll be happy to do that. But why do you do that? And she said, I don't know. It's something my mother taught me. And it's what you do if you're going to cook a good ham. So he's still curious and he says, Well, I'd like to explore this a little bit more. And she said, Fine. So they call her sister, a little older sister, and say, Sister, why do why did mom teach us to cut the butt end of the ham off before we cooked it? And she said, I don't know. I just always did it and think about it. It's the way we've always done it.

So they call Mom, get her on a conference call. It's Christmas anyway, so it's a good time to call Mom. The mom says, I don't know. Grandma always did it that way. So they get grandma on a conference call. They go through the pleasantries. They wish everybody a happy Christmas. And then the the youngest daughter, the newlywed, says to grandma, Grandma, we have a question for you. And we're perplexed as to why you taught us and taught mom to cut the last couple of inches off of a ham on the butt end before you cook it. You always served great ham and it's always worked. But we want to know why it's such a good idea. And she says, Honey, it's very simple. I cut off those last two inches of the ham because I never had a pan big enough to fit the ham. Now that law has been passed down to two more generations where people felt that the right way to cook a ham is to cut the butt end off. No reason to do that if you've got a pan big enough. But how many processes like that exist in organizations today where you're doing something because you've always done it? And you don't know a different way. You don't know why you do it that way, but you do it that way. That's what challenging the process is all about. It's discovering those Christmas hams and putting an end to those practices.

Do you know a leader who does that? And if you do, this is probably a leader that is simultaneously maybe unpopular, but also very effective. Peter Drucker says results are obtained by exploiting opportunities, not solving problems. In fact, this is one of the great criticisms Drucker had of senior management. They are too focused on solving problems and not focused enough on looking ahead. Enabling others to act is our next. Our next practice that is seen as an exemplary thing for leaders to do. It's building relationships in the organization. It's building self efficacy, self determination and confidence. We have talked about this when we talked about motivation. It's making sure people know that they have the ability to do things. It's situational leadership. It's all of those things that we're important. It's using positive reinforcement to make sure people know how important it is that they're recognized. Can you think of a leader who enables others to act, who trusts others to make decisions, who is not afraid of their own shadow? That leader is probably very effective if you can think of that leader. George Patton once again says, never tell people how to do things, Tell them what to do, and they'll surprise you with their ingenuity. Joe Badaracco, who is an author that I collaborate with on not in Writing but but I view some of his materials indicates that hoarding knowledge erodes your power If you want. If something's important, give it away.

Share power. And and that's what enabling others to act. Finally, our last our last practice or our last practice of exemplary leadership is encouraging the heart. Making sure people know that you have observed and recognized when they do something of great value. Celebrate when things go well. Make sure people know that. That you're a community, that you work together. You care about the work that you do. Have you ever met a leader that does this? If you do, you probably met a leader who's very, very effective. Andrew Carnegie said that no one will make a great leader who wants to do it all alone or get all the credit. So don't be afraid to give credit to people when they do a good job. I have been teaching and mentoring people in these five practices for some time now, and the ones that that appreciate it, the ones that apply it, the ones that use their leadership practices, inventory tend to be very much ahead of the class. They're on the fast track. I've worked with some in a local organization and they are taking positions of authority and it's really working. I taught a leadership class for a very large organization. One of the students was one of those rare people who went off and did everything that I talked about. He became so successful that he got promoted to director in this organization, and he's one of the future stars.

I'm not saying everybody's going to have that same fate, but I'm saying that you're more likely to be successful. If you think about some of the things we've talked about in this session than not. I don't want to end on too much of a down note, but I do want to say that not all is is is roses and light and champagne. Sometimes leaders do derail. Why do they derail? And it's important to look at that, I think, before we conclude our session here. Sometimes a leader may be performing at a very high level, but not going as high as the organization expected. Or is the individual expected? Maybe they got promoted very quickly, but they plateaued. They may have even fired or demoted, taken early retirement. Maybe they just aren't achieving their potential. This we call derailment. And let's see what some of the reasons are. Why do they derail? Well, the organization looks at this person and they begin to evolve and they begin to see that as they take on progressively more responsibility, they're don't have the skills and characteristics for the job. They're not up to the job. They get promoted into a very large position, bigger than twice as big, leading twice as many people as they were leading before. And they just don't seem to be able to to to make it. Why does that happen? Well, let's look at some of the primary reasons why they derail. First of all, they probably are trying to lead the bigger organization the same way they led the smaller organization.

In other words, their success might have been in their technical ability or in their ability to pull teams together. And as they reach the executive level, it's more about strategy. It's more about creating external networks, creating alliances externally. One of the big reasons that that the they derail is they don't their interpersonal skills are not matched to the position they're in. The higher you go in an organization, the more important interpersonal skills and relationships become. You've got to be able to build an organization around an idea and a vision. You've got to be able to lead the team and you've got to be able to delegate. Or finally, they just don't meet their objectives. Their organization doesn't do well. It doesn't meet what the expectations of the stockholders or the management requires. In not adapting. What you see is they may have a new boss that and they're not able to to adapt to that, that that new boss and that new style. They're not flexible and they're not resilient. They had a single skill like technical ability or sales ability. You see this with salespeople a lot. Really, really good salespeople. You promote them to an executive level and they're still selling and they may just not be able to to adapt to the increased responsibility. That happens sometimes. And that's some of the big reasons why we see failure in leadership.

So think about these things. I encourage you to think about things that we've talked about for the last 12 sessions, including this one. I hope hopefully you've gotten some skills and ideas about how you can improve the way that you live and lead within your organization. But let me leave you with some parting thoughts and let me leave you with some ideas about future research you can do if you want to learn. This is kind of my list of Warren Bennis books. Any. Warren Bennis book you read is going to be to your benefit geeks and geezers is a really good one, and it talks about generational differences. And I think you would you would certainly appreciate that. On Becoming a Leader might be his seminal book if you don't read any other book by Bennis, read that one, I would suggest. Leaders are learners. If you're going to be a great leader, you're probably going to have to continue your leadership and learning journey by reading, by experiencing by many of the other things that I think we've talked about in 12 sessions. The leadership challenge I would certainly recommend at the top of the list. All of these books I would recommend you take a look at if you have a chance to read them. They can really make a difference in your leadership abilities and your leadership characteristics. We've talked about leadership. It's been studied since recorded time, I think, and some of it has been nonsense.

Some of it has been very good. Lots of different theories. But there's no one theory that that says here's exactly the way that all leaders operate. Social cognitive theory I like because it accounts for both the leader, the subordinate and the environment. And we talked about the five practices of exemplary leadership. It's the most heavily researched and the heavily validated leadership approach that we've seen. So I hope you've enjoyed this journey through the examination of people in organizations. We've accomplished a lot in this course. We've studied the challenges that are facing us in the global environment, from globalization to the impacts of technology. We've looked at the changing work patterns based on the changes in the world and the different generational needs. We've looked at diversity and how that can actually become. If it's managed well and embraced, it can become a competitive advantage. We've talked about ethics in almost every session because of the importance of ethical behavior, as we saw in our leadership characteristics studies. Honesty and integrity are two of the most important elements of a leader's effectiveness, and they define a great leader. It's foundational. We looked at reward systems, the pros and cons, and I gave you an alternative view you might not see in too many places from Alfie Cone about what Alfie believes is the debilitating way that we administer rewards in today's society. We looked at personality type, its uniqueness. We began to understand that human behavior is not random.

And as leaders and engineering managers, if we can understand what human behaviors are and how how drivers affect our behavior, we can be much more effective in understanding the people we lead. We looked at motivational needs. We all have them and they're all different. Everybody is driven by a different set of needs. Although there are some common needs that Maslow talked about in the hierarchy of needs. The need to eat, sleep, drink and and get and to have shelter over our head. The need for safety, the need for sociability, the need for esteem. All of those are things that everybody needs. But they we need them in different levels and in different intensities. We looked at positive organizational behavior, the importance of skills such as emotional intelligence, and we found that hope and optimism can be very positive leadership characteristics, things that can help us in our journey to become better leaders. We also studied the dynamics of competing communications, how important they are, and also the importance of not just the written or the word, but also body language and paralanguage. We learned how to make decisions and we looked at some people who were somewhat troublesome and how we can handle them. We looked at conflict in that whole world and discussed ways to manage that and how to deal with difficult people. We looked at stress and the debilitating effects that that unmanaged distress can can cause us, but there's also eustress and the positive effects of stress.

We looked at conflict in in how we can combine conflict and stress, manage them well and make sure that we are using them to our advantage and not letting them destroy us. Power and politics Always one of my favorite sessions. Power is a natural part of a leader's and a manager's repertoire, and understanding and participating in positive politics can be a great career enhancer. Groups and teams are the way that we do business in society today, so understanding what drives teams and how a good team performs and what the characteristics of good teamwork are and how to situationally lead a team are all important elements to know and learn. We looked at how to manage performance and the near silver bullet of positive reinforcement that always works all the time and how we need to practice more of that. But we need to understand that there are other things that we need to be aware of. Sometimes we need to punish and if we need to do it, we need to do it right. Finally, we looked at leadership. We've talked about that in this session. And I think I hope I've given you some some ideas and skills that you can take forward and continually refine to make yourself a better engineering manager. So I've thoroughly enjoyed being with you these 12 sessions. I hope you've enjoyed it as much as I have, and I'll be signing off now.",6842,"[-0.03039662  0.00357802  0.00684519 ... -0.01675915 -0.00216103

And, the most important aspect of OR problems is that usually they require the allocation of scarce resources. When we refer to a system in the context of operations research, we mean that it's an organization of interdependent components that work together to achieve a certain goal. So, for instance, a manufacturing facility or manufacturing company, their goal consists of maximizing profit, and they are trying by selling their products. But they have to work within certain constraints that pertain to the processes within this manufacturing company. So, a system doesn't necessarily need to be a technical system, like a pump or a car or something like this. It can be in some cases, but it is much more general than this. It's basically components or variables that are organized in a certain way to achieve a certain objective, given that they have to respect some constraints. 
[00:01:38:20] Some of the history about of operations research, basically the term was coined in a during World War Two, when the British military asked the scientists and engineers to analyze some military problems and scenarios and to help in optimizing the deployment of some of their assets, such as radars or convoys, or the management of a convoy, bombing campaign, or any of the assets that are being used and the logistical problems that they have encountered with during the war. 
[00:02:18:24] So, because of this war effort, the whole area of Operations Research was developed to address some military applications and problems and there was an urgent need to optimize the allocation of scarce resources. Now, after the war ended, the success of operations research, got extended and spurred interest in the civil applications as the industrial boom after the war was running its course. The problems, the complexity of the problems, they started to increase and, again, the need for allocation of scarce resources became clear to the business world and to the industrial world. And operations research became an important field to study and to develop. So, 
the techniques that were developed in the military world were actually taken to the business world to solve their problems as well. 
[00:03:40:18] Now, to give you an idea, some of the common applications for operations research include, but not limited to, of course, the following: designing a layout for a factory, in terms of optimizing the flow of materials. So, if you have multiple departments in a factory, you can look at the flow of material between the different departments and optimize the location, or the layout of the different departments, depending on how much material flows between these departments. That's one application. Telecommunication Networks. What is the least expensive way of putting together a telecommunication network without compromising the quality of service? Production Planning: how much should you produce to meet the demand and how much should you store in inventory and how much to outsource, or subcontract, in order to maximize profit? Very traditional and classic problem in production and manufacturing. Designing the layout of a computer chip. We don't think much of this, but in many cases the computer chip -- a robot has to go around the computer chip and do something on it and connect dots and things like this. And all of this is time consumed by the robot. So, if we can optimize the time it takes to do its job per chip, then you would be reducing the total time in the system. 
[00:05:20:21] Managing the flow of material and information sometimes and assets across supply chains. So, a supply chain usually consists of suppliers providing material to manufacturers who provide products to wholesalers and distributors, then finally to retailers and customers. And the flow of this material can be, and the flow of the products and the material, can be complex across the supply chain. So how do you optimize the flow of material and the products across the supply chain. There is a large variety of our applications in that area. With globalization, for instance, you can manufacture a certain product in one country and package it in another country and sell it to another region. Taking advantage of where material can be cheaper and labor can be cheaper without compromising the quality of your product and transporting it back to a certain market -- all of this can be optimized by developing OR models to tell you what is the best plan. Transportation is a big area where you can imagine big delivery companies like FedEx or UPS delivering packages. You can imagine that there are so many decisions that they need to be made. Which truck to drop off? Which shipment? 
And to which location, and so on. To minimize the time, or to reduce the fuel consumption, and so on. So, there is a lot of OR applications in the transportation area. 
[00:07:31:22] We will go over some of the blending problems, such as problems that you see in oil refineries where you can produce the same product, but you have multiple ways of doing things, and you want to find what is the most profitable or the least expensive way of blending these materials to achieve your objective. Pricing is another complicated and complex optimization problem, where sometimes deciding on the price that will maximize the profit may be a complex optimization problem that operations research can help with.

[00:00:06:26] Solving operations research problems, the approach we would follow is very similar to the scientific method that we are familiar with. When we use the scientific method, we usually follow the following steps: we observe a system that we are interested in. We develop a specific hypothesis that we are trying to prove. We test that hypothesis with some experiments, and after we design such experiments, and we then draw some conclusions. And finally report our results. [00:00:45:16] In OR, the approach is very similar. We start by defining a problem and then we formulate a mathematical model. That's the OR model. And then, we typically use a computer-based procedure, or a computer program, to solve the mathematical model. We test this model and implement it and deploy it to help us make decisions. [00:01:16:02] So, let's take one step at a time and talk a little bit about that. The Problem Definition is probably the least discussed topic when OR modeling is discussed. Although it's very important to define the problem properly, and the reason it is not discussed that often and not it's not given as much attention, is because it's difficult to come up with a unified approach to problem definition because different problems they have different conditions, circumstances, constraints and so on. But it's very important to be able to accomplish the true objective. It's very important to define the problem well and to define the right problem because defining the wrong one can basically lead to no solution or the wrong solution. And in some cases, we may end up solving the problem and having a solution, but that solution could be for the wrong problem, and that's very dangerous. When you get no solution, you know that you've done something wrong, but when you get a solution and that solution ends up being for the wrong problem, then it could be misleading or disastrous. So, it's very useful to state an objective or a mission statement to focus the attention on our problem and the scope of our problem and make sure we define it very well. [00:02:48:14] Then we go onto the second step of modeling or building the OR model, which is the OR model is basically an abstraction of reality. It is you look at a real system or a real problem and you simply define a mathematical model that will represent the real system in a mathematical format. Models loosely can be flowcharts procedures, program simulations and so on. But in OR, we really have very specific definition of what an OR model is. Basically, it's a set of mathematical relationships that consists of some decision variables, objective function, and constraints. [00:03:37:17] Probably the easiest way to discuss these components is by providing a simple example. If we consider a certain business that sells, or a manufacturing business that sells a certain product, and suppose that the product cost us $10 a unit to manufacture and it sells for $30, then the model that we're referring to, or the OR model that will be referring to, can be developed using this simple relationship that represents the profit. So our objective is really to maximize the profit and the profit in this case would be the revenue, which is $30 a unit multiplied by x units that we sell, minus the cost of each, the cost of the units which is 10x. [00:04:29:24] This relationship and this equation x represents the number of units produced and sold. And Z represents the profit that these symbols x and Z are referred to as variables. In OR, Z is the variable that's commonly used as an objective to denote the objective function. And the objective function can be a profit or revenue or cost, you can be maximizing profit, or minimizing cost or minimizing time necessary to do something. x is a decision variable, which is basically a variable that represents the number of units that we need to produce and sell. When we have more than one variable, the convention is to use something like ""x1, x2, x3, x4 to xn."" You don't really have to follow this convention, so you can use variables like ""X, Y, V, U, K"" and so on. But typically, you see in OR models that once you have multiple variables, you start using ""x1, x2."" If you have multidimensional variables, you may have x1 to xi,j in a sense, or x1,2, x2,3, x4,5, x6,10 (…), xn,o, and so on. [00:06:00:09] Z here is a dependent variable because its value depends on the value of X, while X is the independent variable because its value doesn't depend on anything. So these are the components of a very simple OR model. [00:06:15:23] Now, the number of products that the company produces depends on some other factor or on some other constraints, such as raw material or labor. Let's say it depends on material or the aluminum material that is from which this product is produced and you need six kilograms per unit. However, there are only 150 kilograms available each day, so you have now a constraint or a restriction on how many you can produce. And this becomes a limiting factor to the amount of profit that you can make because the profit is dependent on how many you produce and how many units you produce is dependent on how much material you have. [00:07:06:20] So in this case, if I want to maximize profit, then the model becomes as follows you maximize Z, which is my profit, and it's equal to $20x. $20x coming from the revenue minus the cost ($30 - $10 = $20) subject to the constraints and the constraints in this case are 6x = 150, meaning the number of components. I need six kilograms for each component, so the number of components multiplied by six must be equal to 150 if I'm going to use all of the material, clearly in a project on a model like this, you would want to use all of the material because the more material you use, the more aluminum you use, you can produce more, and you can sell more, and you can profit more. As you will see in the future, this constraint, in many cases, would be greater than or equal to or less than, or equal to. So, if we want to be more general, this constraint should be 6x less than or equal to 150. But the model when you solve it, it will try to use as much as possible of this material and therefore this constraint, the equality would be probably a very legitimate way to represent it here. The other constraint is x is greater than or equal to zero, which is it's called the non-negative constraint, where you just making sure that the decision variable is not negative. Now, the values of $20 and 150 and 6, these are known as parameters of the model and the parameters are fixed known to the model. So, we have to know how much profit we can make per unit; how much aluminum is available; and how much it costs; how many kilograms per unit we need; how many are available per day. These are parameters that typically are known ahead of time. However, they can change over time. In other words, what if at a certain point you're able to get more than 150 kilograms per day? Then, you change this parameter and then you resolve the model to get the new answer. [00:09:26:27] This is a very simple OR model and to solve it is straightforward. We first can solve the equation of 6x = 250. And from that, we get x is = 25. So, in other words, if I have a maximum, if I can use a maximum 150 kilograms per day, the number of units I would produce is 25. I can't produce more than that because that's the maximum amount available to me. If you substitute this value in the profit equation in the previous slide, you will get $500 a day. So that's my solution. That's my profit. And that's the decision variable value, the optimal value for the number of products that I can produce and sell. [00:10:12:19] Problems like this are easy to formulate and solve using just algebraic methods. However, most real-world problems are more complex, and therefore it's not that easy to solve it by hand. And you need to use computers in general to solve it. And you have different ways of modeling with different tools of modeling problems like this, including Excel, Microsoft Excel. And Solver is the tool that can help you to solve a model like this. [00:10:46:23] The next step after we built a model, we that we need to do some diligence work in terms of verifying the model, validating it, and testing it. Let's distinguish between what these terms mean. Verification is basically making sure that the model is built right. Meaning making sure that the model behaves in the way you think it will behave. That you build it to behave in a certain way and you make sure that it is actually behaving according to your expectations. This includes debugging it, tweaking it, making sure that it produces what you think it should produce. Validation, on the other hand, is making sure that we build the right model. So, the verification is making sure that we built the model right while validation is making sure we build the right model. What that means is we have we need to validate that the model that we built represents the real system, represents the system that we intended to build, and it is a valid representation of reality. Testing is our approach to both verification and validation, so it's basically experimenting with the model to verify and validate it and also to see how reliable and how robust the model is under different circumstances. Validation, in particular, is a challenging task because we need to show that this model is actually a realistic representation of reality. So large models especially can be very difficult to validate because of the large number of decision variables and the relationships between these variables and large number of constraints, possibly. [00:12:42:20] However, we still need to do a thorough testing for the model to identify and correct any problems, any flaws in the model, whether it's in the verification or in the validation. Hopefully, after a certain number of iterations, we end up with a model that's free of flaws and reliable use. The final step in the OR modeling approach is to implement the model to final implementation and deployment, because if the model is not used for its purpose, then the effort is useless. And the success of this phase depends on the person's ability to communicate what the model does and the confidence how confident a person should be, or a decision maker should be, in its results. So, in many cases, our modelers may find themselves as salespersons trying to convince the management or the clients of the importance of the model, why it is good to use that model, and to give them confidence in its results. Getting the decision makers involved in the process early on helps because, as you know, if they are involved from the beginning, the model starts usually simple, then it gets more complex. It's much easier to explain the model if they have the background, rather than all of a sudden presenting them with a complex model. So from a management perspective, that's an important aspect that a modeler should be aware of.",2580,"[ 7.20644929e-03 -5.78330655e-05 -4.26697684e-03 ...  1.25753200e-02

Break Even Analysis,1.3,ORMF,"Title: Break Even Analysis; Description: Break-even analysis is a good topic to expand our discussion of model building The purpose of break-even analysis is to determine the number of units of a product(i.e volume) to sell or produce that will equate total revenue witht the total costThe point that will equate total revenue with total costThe point where total revenue equals total cost is called the break-even point and at this point profit is zero.In this video module, students will learn about the Break-Even Analysis and its importance in business decision-making.

Basically, it's a set of mathematical relationships that consists of some decision variables, objective function, and constraints. [00:03:37:17] Probably the easiest way to discuss these components is by providing a simple example. If we consider a certain business that sells, or a manufacturing business that sells a certain product, and suppose that the product cost us $10 a unit to manufacture and it sells for $30, then the model that we're referring to, or the OR model that will be referring to, can be developed using this simple relationship that represents the profit. So our objective is really to maximize the profit and the profit in this case would be the revenue, which is $30 a unit multiplied by x units that we sell, minus the cost of each, the cost of the units which is 10x. [00:04:29:24] This relationship and this equation x represents the number of units produced and sold. And Z represents the profit that these symbols x and Z are referred to as variables. In OR, Z is the variable that's commonly used as an objective to denote the objective function. And the objective function can be a profit or revenue or cost, you can be maximizing profit, or minimizing cost or minimizing time necessary to do something. x is a decision variable, which is basically a variable that represents the number of units that we need to produce and sell. When we have more than one variable, the convention is to use something like ""x1, x2, x3, x4 to xn."" You don't really have to follow this convention, so you can use variables like ""X, Y, V, U, K"" and so on. But typically, you see in OR models that once you have multiple variables, you start using ""x1, x2."" If you have multidimensional variables, you may have x1 to xi,j in a sense, or x1,2, x2,3, x4,5, x6,10 (…), xn,o, and so on. [00:06:00:09] Z here is a dependent variable because its value depends on the value of X, while X is the independent variable because its value doesn't depend on anything. So these are the components of a very simple OR model. [00:06:15:23] Now, the number of products that the company produces depends on some other factor or on some other constraints, such as raw material or labor. Let's say it depends on material or the aluminum material that is from which this product is produced and you need six kilograms per unit. However, there are only 150 kilograms available each day, so you have now a constraint or a restriction on how many you can produce. And this becomes a limiting factor to the amount of profit that you can make because the profit is dependent on how many you produce and how many units you produce is dependent on how much material you have. [00:07:06:20] So in this case, if I want to maximize profit, then the model becomes as follows you maximize Z, which is my profit, and it's equal to $20x. $20x coming from the revenue minus the cost ($30 - $10 = $20) subject to the constraints and the constraints in this case are 6x = 150, meaning the number of components. I need six kilograms for each component, so the number of components multiplied by six must be equal to 150 if I'm going to use all of the material, clearly in a project on a model like this, you would want to use all of the material because the more material you use, the more aluminum you use, you can produce more, and you can sell more, and you can profit more. As you will see in the future, this constraint, in many cases, would be greater than or equal to or less than, or equal to. So, if we want to be more general, this constraint should be 6x less than or equal to 150. But the model when you solve it, it will try to use as much as possible of this material and therefore this constraint, the equality would be probably a very legitimate way to represent it here. The other constraint is x is greater than or equal to zero, which is it's called the non-negative constraint, where you just making sure that the decision variable is not negative. Now, the values of $20 and 150 and 6, these are known as parameters of the model and the parameters are fixed known to the model. So, we have to know how much profit we can make per unit; how much aluminum is available; and how much it costs; how many kilograms per unit we need; how many are available per day. These are parameters that typically are known ahead of time. However, they can change over time. In other words, what if at a certain point you're able to get more than 150 kilograms per day? Then, you change this parameter and then you resolve the model to get the new answer. [00:09:26:27] This is a very simple OR model and to solve it is straightforward. We first can solve the equation of 6x = 250. And from that, we get x is = 25. So, in other words, if I have a maximum, if I can use a maximum 150 kilograms per day, the number of units I would produce is 25. I can't produce more than that because that's the maximum amount available to me. If you substitute this value in the profit equation in the previous slide, you will get $500 a day. So that's my solution. That's my profit. And that's the decision variable value, the optimal value for the number of products that I can produce and sell. [00:10:12:19] Problems like this are easy to formulate and solve using just algebraic methods. However, most real-world problems are more complex, and therefore it's not that easy to solve it by hand. And you need to use computers in general to solve it. And you have different ways of modeling with different tools of modeling problems like this, including Excel, Microsoft Excel. And Solver is the tool that can help you to solve a model like this. [00:10:46:23] The next step after we built a model, we that we need to do some diligence work in terms of verifying the model, validating it, and testing it. Let's distinguish between what these terms mean. Verification is basically making sure that the model is built right. Meaning making sure that the model behaves in the way you think it will behave. That you build it to behave in a certain way and you make sure that it is actually behaving according to your expectations. This includes debugging it, tweaking it, making sure that it produces what you think it should produce. Validation, on the other hand, is making sure that we build the right model. So, the verification is making sure that we built the model right while validation is making sure we build the right model. What that means is we have we need to validate that the model that we built represents the real system, represents the system that we intended to build, and it is a valid representation of reality. Testing is our approach to both verification and validation, so it's basically experimenting with the model to verify and validate it and also to see how reliable and how robust the model is under different circumstances. Validation, in particular, is a challenging task because we need to show that this model is actually a realistic representation of reality. So large models especially can be very difficult to validate because of the large number of decision variables and the relationships between these variables and large number of constraints, possibly. [00:12:42:20] However, we still need to do a thorough testing for the model to identify and correct any problems, any flaws in the model, whether it's in the verification or in the validation. Hopefully, after a certain number of iterations, we end up with a model that's free of flaws and reliable use. The final step in the OR modeling approach is to implement the model to final implementation and deployment, because if the model is not used for its purpose, then the effort is useless. And the success of this phase depends on the person's ability to communicate what the model does and the confidence how confident a person should be, or a decision maker should be, in its results. So, in many cases, our modelers may find themselves as salespersons trying to convince the management or the clients of the importance of the model, why it is good to use that model, and to give them confidence in its results. Getting the decision makers involved in the process early on helps because, as you know, if they are involved from the beginning, the model starts usually simple, then it gets more complex. It's much easier to explain the model if they have the background, rather than all of a sudden presenting them with a complex model. So from a management perspective, that's an important aspect that a modeler should be aware of.",2586,"[-0.00060931 -0.00812517 -0.00832257 ...  0.01330847  0.00053926

Suppose that you need to decide between two cell phone plans. You need to buy a cell phone plan and you need to select between two. The regular plan you pay $55 a month for the first 1000 minutes and then you pay 33 cents a minute for any time you go over the 1000 minute block. And the executive plan, you pay $100 a month for the first 1200 minutes and then you pay 25 cents a minute over the 1200 minute block and what we required is to determine which plan you would go with, assuming that you need to use the phone for 21 hours. And that would be equivalent to 1260 minutes per month. And at what point these two plans become indifferent? Let's write down for each one of these plans, how much the cost would be, and then we would pick the one that will cost us the least. So, in the first plan, for the regular plan, it will cost us $55 a month up front for the first 1000 minutes and then anything above a thousand. So if n is the number of minutes minus 1000, I multiply this by 0.33. So as if the $55 is like a fixed cost and the n - 1000 is my variable cost, anything above 1000. So if my limit of use is as described by the problem 1260, which is the 21 hours, then my cost will be 55 + 1260 – (1000 * 0.33). And that will end up being equal to 140.8. That's my cost. And the executive plan. I will have to pay $100 for the first 1200 minutes. And anything above that, so n - 1200, anything above that, you will have to pay 25 cents a minute. And in this case, if I have 1260 usage. So, 1260 - 100, that gives me a 60 *.25, and that gives me 115. So clearly for this part, I will go with the executive plan because it is it has lower costs, so I will choose the executive plan, Now, in the second part, we want to see at what point these two plans become equal or indifferent. So, what we could be tempted to do is to say, OK, if I take the cost of the regular plan and make it equal to the cost of executive plan and then solve for n. At what point do they become equal? I solve for n then I find the number of minutes at which they break even. In other words. I can say the 55 + n-1000*0.33 = 100 + n - 122*0.25. If you solve for n, you arrange these terms and solve for and you will find that n is equal to 937. However, although this may sound reasonable. Think about a scenario where n is less than a 1000 for the regular plan, or it is less than a 1200 for the executive plan. In other words, if we look at these two terms, what happens if n was less than the 1000 in case of a regular plan? Let's say if it was 900, if it's 900, this term will end up being negative. The term over here will end up being negative and it is as if the plan will pay us back for using less minutes than our limit, and that's not actually true. So, we need something to make sure that this number doesn't become negative. So, the right formula then to use so this solution actually is incorrect for Part B, The right formula to use is to say I want the cost of the regular plan to be 55 plus maximum of 0 or the difference between n - 1000 multiplied by 0.33. So, what happens here, if you have anything less than a thousand, it will be this term will become negative and therefore the 0 will be picked. And this whole term, drops from the equation so that your cost is 55, which is actually what happens in reality. If you use anything below 1000, you're going to pay 55. Even if you don't use your phone at all, you're still going to have to pay the 55. The plan doesn't pay you back for using less minutes. The same thing with the executive plan. This would be equal to 100 plus maximum of 0 and the difference between n -1200*0.25. And at the same token, this term, if this becomes negative, suppose that you use a 1000 minutes on this plan, this means that you have -200, this formula, the maximum, the maximum of 0 and that term will pick up the 0 because the other one is a negative number. And this way, this whole term will end up being 0 and you will end up paying only $100 because that's the minimum that you're going to pay on the executive plan. Now, how do we solve this equation? It may not be very straightforward to solve it by hand. So let me show an Excel file that demonstrates this problem. In this Excel file, you see that I have here the minutes where I start from minute 0 and I increment each row by one minute and I calculate the regular costs for the regular plan and the executive plan. So, for the regular plan, the cost is $55 regardless how many minutes you use up to a certain limit, up to 1000 minutes and then for the executive plan, the cost is $100 up to a usage of 1200 minutes. And then I calculate the difference between these two plans. The break-even point is when I have a difference of zero between them. Let's take a look at the regular plan cost. So, as I use minutes, I still pay 55, so if I scroll down all the way down to 1000, and if you focus on the regular plan cost, as you can see, it's 55 up to minute 1000. As I pass the 1000 limit. Then I will be paying 33 cents per minute and for this additional minute over the 1000 and then 66 cents because I'm now using 2 minutes over a 1000 and so on. And that grows linearly. Anything that I use over 1000 will be 33 cents a minute. If you look at the executive plan, it starts out at $100 as a minimum fee. So, if you use 0 minutes or up to 1200 minutes, it's still $100. And then so if I scroll down, as you can see, the executive cost executive plan cost is $100 all the way up to 1200 minutes, okay? And once I pass that, I will start paying 25 cents a minute. So, for 1201, I have 125 cents and then for 1202, 250 cents and so on, it will grow linearly. And in this column, I just calculate the difference. So initially the difference between them is $45. I just take the difference between the executive cost and the regular cost. And the way I calculate the regular cost. Basically, I have 55 in these cells, OK, and I have 100 for these cells until the until they get to their limit of 1000 or 1200. So, in the regular cost, I have 55 in the cell. No formula or anything until I get down to 1000. So, when I get down to 1000 minutes, and here I now have the 55 plus 33 cents multiplied by the difference between the number of minutes - 1000, similar to the formula that we showed earlier and the same with the executive plan, except that I will have $100 all the way up to 1200. And then after 1200, I plug in the formula that takes the 100 and adds to 25 cents for each minute above the 1000 so I take that number of minutes used - 1200. I multiply this by 25 cents. That would give me the additional cost over 100. And the difference formula is just the difference between these two plans, the executive minus the regular. So, the difference initially, if at a lower level of minutes, that the difference is significant $45. But as I go up and I reach the level of 1000, this is when the regular plan cost starts to change. You start to see that the difference starts dropping, because now I'm paying 33 cents a minute for every minute above 1000. So, the difference between the two plans starts to decline and I want to see at what point that difference becomes 0. So, if I scroll down and I get to a point where at 11:36 minutes, the difference becomes almost 0. It's 12 cents. You're not going to get a 0 per se. So, at this point, it drops to 12 cents. And then once I exceed the 11:36 minutes, the executive plan starts to become cheaper than the regular plan. So, because the rate at which the executive plan grows is less than the regular plan, the regular plan grows at 33 cents a minute, while the executive plan grows at 25 cents a minute. So, at this point, they break even where there is really no difference if you know that you'll be using up to 11:36 minutes. There is no difference between the executive and regular. If you exceed this number, it is more beneficial for you to buy the executive and if anything less than 11:36 it will be more beneficial to buy the regular plan. In real life, typically, we are not really that sure about how many minutes we're going to use. So, if you're going to use something close to 11:36 in that area, I would go with the executive plan because, you know, the difference of $2 to $3 may not be worth the risk of going over your minutes on the regular plan. But the exact solution is to is that this is the break-even point, the 11:36, so if you know, for sure, your number of minutes is less than this you can go with the regular plan. If it's more than this, you can go with the executive plan. Just to visualize what's going on here, we have this chart that shows both plans. So, as you can see with the regular cost plan, it has a lower fixed cost up to a thousand minutes and then it grows linearly at 33 cents a minute. And the executive plan is that it has a fixed cost of $100 and at 1200, it will grow at a linear cost of 25 cents a minute. At this point, this is when both plans become indifferent. At this level of usage, they become indifferent, which is really around 11:36. It's in the chart. It may show a little bit above or below, but that's the data. This chart is drawn based on this data, and this is exactly the break-even point. So, as you can see these two plans, they diverge after that point, and it will always be cheaper to go with the executive plan once you pass this point. There is no need for you to consider the regular plan if you're going to have more than 11:36 minutes. And this is where when we play a little bit with a sensitivity analysis and you can say, OK, what if I use more than the 21 hours per month or at the 12:60 demand? I'm above the 11:36, so I know for sure I'm going with the executive. But what if I use significantly less minutes, then anything below 11:36 minutes. I will go with the regular with the regular cost. So that's where that break-even point is. And this problem not the traditional break-even analysis. So, I thought that it is worth stopping for a little bit and pointing out pointing out this, this particular problem.",2635,"[ 0.00253499 -0.01226696  0.01674835 ...  0.00596292  0.00052673

Linear Programming Modeling,2.1,LPGS,"Title: Linear Programming Modeling; Description: Often our goals as a management scientist are to efficiently allocate resourcesWe most often are trying to maximize or minimize some objective functionMany times these functions are profit or costIn this module, we will walk through an example of how to formulate an Linear programming model. We will cover the steps involved in defining the decision variables, objective function, and constraints for a specific problem. By the end of this module, you will have a good understanding of how to apply the modeling process to real-world problems.Decision variables Objective function Constraints FeasibleSolutions; Transcript: [00:00:01:23] Let me introduce now linear programming and model formulation. At some point, a company or an organization needs to make decisions that pertain to resource allocation for the most part. And managers are usually concerned with the benefit of the company, and they have the tendency to maximize profit if it was a for profit organization. Or if it was a non-profit organization, it will be maximizing the satisfaction or the service level. Usually managers have the tendency to trust their gut and experience and maybe some additional tools that are available to them. However, this may not be the best way to take actions and to make decisions, especially when it comes to problems that have a level of difficulty that requires intelligent methods and optimization methods such as operations research methods, and the decisions that usually they have to make, they pertain to money or people or equipment or material or customers deadlines and so on. So, these are important parameters or important aspects of the model that we need to make decisions on. So, it's important that we do our best to optimize them. Most of the companies or organizations, as you will see they try to maximize profit or in some cases it could be maximizing the service level or maximizing the customer satisfaction. Even when companies try to maximize profit, they still have in mind their satisfaction or the service level of their customers. Some organizations or departments within an organization may have objectives of minimizing costs or minimizing waste or idle time and so on. Most of these problems and decisions are not really that easy to solve by hand or just by inspecting them, especially when they have a lot of possibilities. And there are many options to choose from and we want to choose the best one. In this case, operations research tools become a very good path to take and approach to follow. And one of these tools and within the area of operations research is linear programming. Linear programming, which was introduced by George Dantzig during and after World War Two is used when there is a certain objective to optimize. Meaning we want to minimize something or maximize something and we have certain constraints and we can apply linear programming to optimize that objective and respect the constraints that restrict the problem. There are three steps in general in linear programming. First, (1) the problems must be identified as being problems that can be solved by linear programming and then (2) the unstructured problem can be formulated or structured as a mathematical model, and (3) we can use mathematical techniques to solve this problem. So, these are the three general aspects that need to be considered before we can solve a problem as a linear program. It has to be solvable by linear programming. The unstructured or real problem needs to be structured in a mathematical form. And it can be the standard method of solving can be used with that with that model. There are four main components in linear programs. First, decision variables and these are the variables that are presented by some symbols like x1, x2 and so on, and they represent the level of variables of interest that must be determined. So it can be that we are trying to determine the number of units to solve, or the number of units to produce. These activities or these products or the items that we are trying to decide on are known as the decision variables. They are independent variables that we can assign any value; most of the time a non-negative value. Objective function is basically a linear mathematical equation or form that describes what we are trying to maximize or minimize. So, it could be that we are trying to maximize the profit, or minimize the cost or maximize the service level, or minimize the waste, or the idle time. So that's another component of the objective function. Constraints are the restrictions around the problem where they restrict us from going to a certain areas within the domain of the variables. So, for instance, you may have constraints on how much resources you have available to you like labor or material. You may have environmental restrictions or constraints. You may have preferences that can be set up as constraints. So any restriction to the problem is modelled by the use of constraints. The parameters are the coefficients and constants used in the objective function and constraints. These are the parameters. So, if you have a coefficient multiply, let's say 2x, the 2 would be a parameter to the variable x. Now, for linear programming to be used, clearly we have to have linear relationships among the variables within the objective function and the constraints. So, what this means is that the change rate for each unit and of the decision variables is for a certain decision, the variable is the same. So, for instance, if the increase in profit as you increase the price from $20 to $21 will be the same as increasing the price from $30 to $31, so the change rate is the same, meaning it's linear. So, it's as if you have a straight line with a slope of a certain amount, and that slope would be the same. Whether you increase from level 1 to level 2 or from level 2 to level 3, the rate still stays the same. Now we also need to make sure that the relationships are linear by inspecting the degree of the functions, so we have to have function degree of 1 only. So how do we figure out the degree of the function? If you recall, we look at the highest degree of each term within a function, so a function may have or an equation may have multiple terms, welook at the highest degree of each term and we pick the maximum one and that will be the degree of our function. So, for instance, in they if we have the equation x 2 + x5x + 1 . This is a function of degree 2 because the highest level or the highest degree of this term is 2; the highest, the second term, it's of a degree 1. So, the highest one is 2. So the whole function will be of degree 2. How about this function right here (2x2y + 3xy + y)? You can pause at this point and think about it a little bit to see what your what your answer is. So, what is the degree of this function? Well, this function is of degree 3 because for the first term, we have the x is of degree 2 and the y of degree 1. And whenever we multiply two variables like this, we add up the powers. So, we add the power of 2 and 1, and that will be of degree 3. Over here for the xy, I have here degree 1 and here degree 1. When I multiply them, I will add them up. So, that will give me a function of degree 2 and the power of degree of y is degree 1. So, the maximum of all of these terms is 3; the powers they add up for term 1, it's 3 and for term 2 it's 2 and for term 3, it's 1. So, the maximum of all of these terms is 3. So, the whole function is of degree 3. So, that is a nonlinear function. So, for a function to be linear, it has to be of degree 1 and must be only multiplied. The variables must only be multiplied by constants and not by each other. So, for instance, 3x1 that will be linear 2x1 + 5x2, that will be linear and so on. All of these functions that you see that these functions are all linear. However, because as you see the coefficients are multiplied by the variables. But in this case, this is a nonlinear relationship because we are multiplying at a variable of degree 1 with another variable of degree 1 and that will give us a function with degree of 2. And in this case, that cannot be a linear program. So, we have to make sure that the relationship is linear by inspecting first the degree of the functions and the constraints, and make sure that the the powers, and the decision variables don't result in a function with a degree that's higher than 1. So, it has to be a function with degree of 1. There are some implicit properties that must exist for linear programming to work, and these include proportionality, additive, continuous or divisible, and certainty. Let's take a look at each one of these. Proportionality. This means that the slope of a constraint or the objective function line is constant, so I have a constant multiplied by a decision variable. Basically it's a linear equation and the constant slope based constitute a degree 1 function. So, if I have 2x, the constant is of degree 1 and the variable is of degree 1, and the 2 is a constant. So, basically the whole thing would be of degree 1. So, the line, in other words, must be straight. It can have a function. It can have a parameter, or it has a coefficient of a certain constant. But we cannot have two variables multiplied by each other. So, this is the proportionality attribute, and it is linked to what we just discussed now about the function degree. The second attribute that is important is the additive where the terms and the objective function or the constraints must be additive. We can add them up, so decision variables must be multiplied only by constants and not by each other. So, we cannot multiply decision variables by each other. This is a very common mistake that people sometimes make when they are formulating linear programs where they define decision variables and to formulate the constraints they, in some cases, end up multiplying decision variables thinking that if there are no powers, like if there is no variable to the power 2 or 3 , it means it's linear. No, it's not. If you multiply that the two decision variables such as x1 and x to multiply them by each other that will form a function of degree 2 which is nonlinear so you cannot multiply in linear programming decision variables by each other. Otherwise, the problem will turn into a nonlinear program. So, for instance, if the volume and the price are both decision variables, if they are both unknown, we are trying to determine the volume and the price, and we end up multiplying them to calculate the revenue. This will create a nonlinear property, which is a violation of the additive property. Ok, so that's not allowed. So, one of them needs to be a constant for this equation to work and be used and it doesn't mean that it's wrong. It's just nonlinear and you cannot use linear programming with it. Also, continuous or divisible, so the decision variables must be continuous variables, meaning not restricted to integer values, and they can take fractional values, although in reality you may have decision variables that are not continuous, such as number of people, or number of cars, or number of products, and so on. These are integer values. However, we will have to assume in linear programming that they are continuous variables where you may get a fractional value and then you can round this value. We will discuss more on of this topic when we talk about integer programming for cases where you must have integer values and you cannot have continuous values and the problem becomes quite different. So, as an example here to fulfill or to satisfy this property, if you get 2.1 people, you must be willing to accept that this number can be rounded to two people, for instance. And finally, the parameters of the objective function or the constraints must be known with certainty. So, the model parameters or basically the coefficients of the coefficients of variables in the constraints and on the objective function must be constant with known values. In reality, this may not be the case. So, for instance, you may have a variable cost per unit that can be estimated using some other models. So, it is not necessarily a constant value, but we deal with this issue by the use of sensitivity analysis. For linear programming to work, you will have to assume at that point in time when you're solving a linear program that a coefficient of a certain variable is known with certainty. So, it's 2, or 3, or 5, and so on. And you can then conduct sensitivity analysis to help you understand the impact of changing the parameters on the solution.",2657,"[ 0.00712601  0.00299149 -0.00941861 ...  0.00628016 -0.01732188

Linear Programming Model Formulation Example,2.2,LPGS,"Title: Linear Programming Model Formulation Example; Description: Linear Programming Model Formulation Example; Transcript: [00:00:00:29] Let's go over a linear program model formulation example. Suppose that we have a company that produces bowls and mugs. These are the two products that this company produces, and the only resources that we’ll be considering are the material, which is the clay and the labor, and the company makes $40 per bowl and $50 per month when they sell their products. And to make a bowl, it requires four pounds of clay, while making a mug requires three pounds of clay. A bowl needs one hour of labor and a mug needs two hours of labor. Forty hours of labor are available, so we have a total of 40 hours per day available, and 120 pounds of clay is available per day. And the question we're trying to answer is how many bowls and mugs can this company produce to maximize profit? So, their objective is to maximize profit, but they are limited by the amount of material and labor to them. So, clearly a problem like this is not necessarily straightforward because we have many combinations of balls and mugs to consider. And even though this is considered a very simple problem, it is not very easy to solve by hand or to figure out just by inspecting it. So, the first step that I recommend that you do is first organize your data, get a good understanding of the problem by organizing its data, and defining the objectives very clearly. [00:01:51:23] So in this case, the products we are producing are bowls and mugs, and to produce a ball we require one hour of labor and four pounds of clay. And it sells for $40 and for mugs, it requires two hours of labor and three pounds of clay. And the profit is $50. The resources available for labor, all resources available for labor are the amount of labor hours available is 40 hours per day and for clay we have 120 pounds per day. That's our data for this problem. And so, the first step is to define what our decision variables are, define what our objective is, and what the constraints are. So, in the first case, what's what is it that we're trying to decide? Well, we're trying to decide how many bowls and how many mugs to produce in order to maximize profit. So, our decision variables are the number of bowls and the number of mugs. We can give them a short symbol like x1 and x2. Our objective is to maximize profit. It's very well defined in this case. And the third step that we need to take is to define our constraints. We have limitations on the amounts of resources available to us, namely the clay and labor. So. To define our decision variables, I used x1 and x2 as the variables of choice for to represent the number of polls and number of months produced per day. [00:03:45:04] My objective function is to maximize profit. If I make forty dollars per bowl and fifty dollars per month, then I produce x1 balls. I find that the number of balls to be produced at x1, then my profit is going to be 40 multiplied by the number of balls I produce. And if I produce x2 two and I make $50 per piece, then my total profit by selling mugs is 50x2. So the total profit is 40x1 plus 50x2 out of selling both bowls and mugs, and Z represents my profit per day. Now, if I didn't have any constraints, then the problem will be the amount of profit I make is unlimited, which is not very realistic. So typically, I have certain resources available to me. I have 40 hours of labor per day and 120 pounds of clay to use, so I cannot exceed the 40 hours and I cannot exceed 120 pounds. It takes one hour to produce a bowl and two hours of produce a mug. So, if I produce x1 balls and x2 mugs, it means that x1 plus two hours for each bowl for each month multiplied by the number of mugs must be less than 40. So, this constraint right here reflects the labor constraint where I cannot exceed 40 hours per day. [00:05:23:09] And this the left-hand side is the amount of hours I will use to produce these bowls and mugs and the same thing for the material. If it takes four pounds of clay to produce a bowl and I have x1 bowls, it means I need 4x1 hour lbs of clay. And also, it takes three pounds of clay to produce a mug. So if I produce x2 months, it means that I need 3x2 pounds of clay. So that's the total amount of clay I'm going to use and cannot be more than 120 per day. The last constraint is the non-negativity constraint, a very important constraint to be able to solve linear programs, which is basically indicating that both x1 and x2 cannot be negative. They are not negativity constraint x1 greater than zero and x2 is greater than or equal to zero. They can be zero, but not negative. So, to summarize our product, our formulation for our products, I defined my decision variables and I had defined my profit just like before, and I let my equations maximize the profit z, which is equal to 4x1 plus 50x2, subject to whenever I put the word or the phrase subject to it means that whatever comes after is basically a set of constraints. x1 one x1 plus two x2 is less than four and 4x1 plus 3x2 is less than or equal to 120 and then on negativity constraints. [00:07:07:00] This is a summary of our formulation. So, whenever you're asked to formulate a linear program, by the end, you need to have something of this form. You need to have first a definition of your decision variables and objective function. And then you lay out the objective function and the constraints in terms of these decision variables, just like what you see. So that's considered an Linear programming model. Now, the next step is to actually solve this model. Solving this problem may result in one of the following possibilities: you may have a feasible solution, which is basically a solution that satisfies all constraints, but we don't know whether it's optimal or not. So, it's a solution, it's a possibility, but we don't know if that's the best solution or not. An optimal solution is the best feasible solution. That means that this solution is the solution that will give you the maximum amount of profit in this case. Multiple optimal solutions are when I have more than one best solution, so if my maximum amount of profit was, let's say, $500, I may have more than one possible solution that leads to the same profit. So, I may produce 10 mugs and 15 bowls. And that same answer may end up being the same if I produce some other combination of products, but the amount of profit is the same, so that's considered the multiple optimal solution. [00:08:55:13] So I have more than one optimal solution. An infeasible solution is when I violate at least one of the constraints, even if one constraint is violated, the solution is infeasible. An unbounded solution is when I have unlimited amount of profit that I can make. Usually, it's not realistic to have that kind of outcome. The rest of the outcomes are possible, including the infeasible solutions. If the problem is over constraint, meaning you cannot even find a feasible solution. The unbounded solution is usually there is a mistake in the model or the problem described is incomplete because it's unrealistic. So, in our example, a feasible solution doesn't violate any of the constraints, but we don't know if it's optimal or not. As an example, if we pick x1 to be five bowls and x to 10 mugs, the amount of profit will be 40 by x1, 40 by five plus 50 by 10. That gives us $700 in profit. Is this the maximum amount of profit we can achieve? Possibly, maybe not. We don't know, but that's a feasible solution, because if you check the constraints, the labor constraint, plug in the values of x1 and x2 into the labor constraint… [00:10:19:17] …So if we go back to these equations, if you plug in five here and 10 here, you will end up with 25, which is less than the maximum number of hours. And if you plug in x1 for the clay constraint, we plug in five for x1 and 10 for x2. We end up with 70 pounds of clay. So, this is a feasible solution, but not necessarily optimal. And the reason I can tell it's not optimal is because I'm not using all of my resources so I can use a little more resources. And if these numbers increase, the profit will increase. So, if x1 and x2 increase, it means that the amount of resources I will use will increase and therefore the profit will increase. So, since in both constraints, I have still amounts that are unused, most likely, this is not an optimal solution. And keep in mind that an optimal solution must be feasible, but not every feasible solution is an optimal solution. So, if you get the best amount of profit, the maximum amount of profit, that maximum amount must satisfy the constraint. However, if you have a solution that satisfies the constraints, that doesn't mean that this is the best solution. You may have some other solution that's better than this solution, so this is considered a feasible solution, which is basically a solution that satisfies all constraints. [00:12:00:17] An infeasible solution is a solution that violates at least one of the constraints. So even if you have a violation of one of the constraints, the solution becomes infeasible. For example, if I have x1(10) and x2(20), if you look at the objective function, yes, I can achieve higher profit – 1400. But if you look at the labor constraint, it's basically you need 50 hours to be able to produce this kind of production 10 and 20, which is more than 40 hours. And so that's a clear violation of the labor constraint. If I find one violation for one of the constraints, I don't even have to check the rest of them because that's a direct violation of the of the model and that will be considered infeasible. So, now the question is how do I find the optimal solution? And this is what we're really after we are trying to find, given our constraints, given our resources. What are the best values that we can give our decision variable -- my optimal solution, which can be maximizing the profit. So, in this course, we will be dealing with a lot of problems. But the common thing among these different problems is that we are trying to find the optimal solution for the model and this is what we will learn throughout the course.",2339,"[ 0.01021928  0.00597596 -0.00642383 ...  0.01033043 -0.0214716

Let's explain this method through the use of an example where we have a company that produces two products: bowls and mugs, and the only resources available or involved in the process are the clay and labor. The profit per bowl is $40, while the profit for each mug, $50 and a bowl requires four pounds of clay. And a mug requires three pounds of clay, while a bowl requires one hour of labor and the mug requires two hours of labor. We have 40 hours available of labor and 20 pounds of clay available per day for both products. And the question is how many bowls and mugs should we produce to maximize profit? And we have to respect the constraints. So, let's go through the process of the graphical solution using this example. The formulation, the mathematical formulation of the linear program is to maximize profit,which is $40 per each unit of x1, which is defined as the bowl. So 40x1 + 50x2, which is the number of mugs produced, will give me the total amount of profit. And the constraints are that we cannot exceed the 40 hours of labor. Each bowl requires one hour and each mug requires two hours, so we show x11 + 2x2 must be less than a total of forty hours. And as far as the clay, we need 4 pounds for each bowl and 3 pounds for each mug. So, 44 by the number I produce, plus three by the number I produce of mugs, which is extra must be less than 120 pounds, and both bowls and mugs must be greater than or equal to zero. [00:02:22:06] We start by plotting the the decision variables on the x and y axis. It's up to us to decide which variable goes where. So, if I defined x1 as the number of bowls, I put it on the x axis over here and I have x2, which is the number of mugs on the y axis right here. The first step is to plot the constraints. And to plot the constraints, recall that our model is listed here and where x1is on the x axis x2 is on the y axis. So, if I want to plot the first constraint, which is the labor constraint, I will pretend that this inequality is an equation now, and I will define a line to plot on this graph, so if I say x1 + 2x2 = 40.. Then to plot this line, I can simply say if x1 = 0, then x2 = 20. And the same way, if x2 = 0. So the x2 gives us this point. And if x2 - 0, then x1 would be from this equation, it would be 40. And that gives us this other point. If I connect them, I will end up with this line over here, and this represents the labor constraint. Anything that falls on this line is represented by this equation and anything less than or equal to 40 is within the feasible region over here. Anything that is less than or equal to 40 would be within this region. So, to know to know that feasible region with respect to that particular constraint, which is the labor constraint, I can just pick any value and plug it into the equation and see if it's less than or greater than 40. [00:04:57:18] So for instance, in this equation, in this case, if I plug in x1 = 10 and x2 = 10 arbitrarily, so I tried in other words, this point A of x1 = 10, x2 = 10) . If you plug it back into this equation, that will give me 30, which is less than 40. So, this point is within the shaded area. Point A is the area and therefore the shaded area here and on this side of the constraint is the feasible region. So, this answers the question how do I know whether the feasible region is on this side of the graph or on this side of the graph? So, I just simply pick any arbitrary point I could have picked a point on this side. So, I could have picked, let's say, 30 and 30 or 40 and 30, as we did over here. And if you plug in 40 and 30 in the equation, it will end up being more than 40. So, it is the infeasible region on the other side on the shaded area. So, the shaded area over here is my feasible region with respect to the labor constraints. So, with respect to labor, I'm good as long as the point is within this region. Plus, the second constraint, which is the clear constraint this one. [00:06:33:05] And similarly, I can just say when x1 = 0, x2 = 40, because if I plug in 2x1 = 0, then 3x2 = 120, and therefore extra will be equal to 40. And when x2 = 0 again, I will have 4x1 =120 and therefore x1 = 30. So, that gave us the first point of the first point was when x1 = 0 x2 was here. And this is the second point. If I connect them, I get this equation 4x1 + 3x2 = 20. Anything that falls on this line will be an equal sign, and anything within this feasible within this region will be less than or equal to 20. And again, we can plug in any two numbers. So, let's say if we plug in 10 and 10, that will give me 40 + 30, and that's less than 120. It means that the shaded area over here is the feasible region with respect to this constraint. Now, I overlay both constraints on the same graph. So, take the common area for both constraints to represent the feasible region for the whole problem. So, my first constraint labor is right here, and my clay constraint is right here. And the common area is considered the feasible region for both of them. [00:08:23:03] In other words, in this unshielded area over here that's only feasible with respect to the material or the clay. So, any point within this area is feasible only with for one constraint, but it's not feasible for the other constraint. It violates the labor constraint. So, for both constraints to be satisfied, feasible points need to be within this shaded region in the in the area that you see in the blue. So, the optimal solution is somewhere within this shaded area. Now as an exercise, you can try different points. So, for instance, if you try this point over here of 30 and maybe 25, you will see that it violates both constraints. If you try points, it will violate one of the constraints, which is the labor constraint, but not the material constraint. However, if you try point r, it will satisfy both constraints. So generally speaking, the intersection among all constraints represents the feasible region, and you can always pick arbitrary points to verify that that this is the case. So this is known as my feasible region. And the next step after we plot all of the constraints and define the feasible region, we need to plot our objective function. [00:10:13:22] Our objective function is this equation, and for us to plot the objective function, we just need to pick any arbitrary value for the equation, so in other words, I can just take that equation of 40x1 + 50x2 and make it equal to any value that you want. Pick something that's convenient to calculate. Instead of having a lot of fractions and things like this, maybe you can pick a value that will be convenient to calculate. Keep in mind that the objective function there is really no specific value that it can take. It just takes whatever the values of x1 and x2 take. This is why we could just pick any arbitrary value. To show you how, what, how that works. I need to plot the equation in order to to figure out the slope. And in this case, if you look at this graph, this line, the dashed line represents the objective function and we just pick any arbitrary value and figure out the slope from that equation. And once we have the slope, then the objective function can be anything that's parallel to this line in this direction or in this direction. Let me explain a little bit more, because that's usually something that people question all the time -- how we figure out the objective function, equation or line. [00:11:54:28] So if I have an equation of z = 40x1 + 50x2. And I can just set this to any value, let's say, 200. Any value. I pick 200 because it's convenient to work with in terms as we have multiples of 40s and 50s. Now if I set x to equal to 0, x1 = 0. What does that leave? x2 = 4. And if I set x2 = 0, that leaves x1 = 5. So, if I go back to my graph, if x1 = 0, x2 = 4, so it is somewhere here and when x2 = 0, x1 = 5, so it's somewhere here. So if I connect that line it will end up being something like this. So, I figured out this way the slope of the line, I don't know the value of the objective function because that depends on the values of x1 and x2. However, I know the slope basically the proportion of x1 compared to x2. That's really the slope of the objective function. If you picked some other value of the objective function, you will end up with the same slope. [00:13:35:22] Meaning if you set it equal to, let's say, 800 instead of 200, you will end up with just a different location for the objective function. But it is going to be with the same slope and you can try that. So, in this, for instance, the proportion between, according to my calculations here, I figured that the proportion of whenever x1 = 5, x2 = 4. If I multiply this by two, let's say it means that when x1 = 10, x2 = 8. As long as the slope is the same, this can take the objective function value, which is the profit can take different values. So, over here, if x1 = 5, x2 = 4. If then in the same way, if x 1 = 10, then x2 = 8. And if x1 is, let's say, 20 x2 would be 16. It's the same proportion, it's the same slope. So, as you can see the objective function, we don't really know the optimal value of the object function yet because it depends on the values of x1 and x2. But we know the trend, we know the slope of the objective function. So once we do that, we need then to identify where the optimal value for that objective function is. [00:15:07:09] Ok. So, as you can see here, the objective function can have different values, so in this case, it is equal to 800. Any combination of x1 and x2 will achieve a profit of 800. If the line was like this, where x1 = 20 and x2 = 16 and I could have picked x1 = 30 then I figure out x2 and so on. So, all of these objective functions are parallel to each other, and they take different equations depending on how I set it to. So, what should we want as the solution? What is the optimal solution? How much in an optimal solution, how much the value of z should be? 800, 1200, 600 or something else? Well, the optimal value has to be feasible, and the feasible region is the shaded area that we have over here. So, an equation like this over here is outside of the feasible region and cannot be achieved, so a 1600 profit cannot be achieved simply because it violates the feasibility of the constraints. In this case over here, some values are feasible, some other values are not feasible. Maybe that is the optimal solution is on this line. Or is it on this line, or some other line? Well, it turns out that the optimal solution is the last point in the feasible region that an objective function touches while moving outwards from the origin if we are doing maximization problems. So, the last point in the feasible region, this is my feasible region over here, the shaded area, and the last point, the objective function touches is point B. We know that this is the slope of the objective function, so the arrows that you see over here, they just represent the movement direction of the objective function, and this objective function was drawn parallel. So, this value, this z equation, is parallel to this equation and parallel maybe to some other equation here and so on. So, the last point that this objective going outwards, so, if you just imagine that this line is moving outwards away from the origin and maximization problems, the last point that it will touch is point B, and that would be the optimal solution. Another thing to be aware of, the optimal solution is going to always be on one of these corners, it will not be somewhere in the middle of this area in linear programming. So, the optimal solution has to be on this corner or this corner or this corner or this corner. So, I have four possible corners to evaluate. [00:18:21:17] So, in order to identify the optimal solution, you can either draw a parallel to the objective function as it goes outwards and then identify the last point it will touch. Or you can simply evaluate the corners, the four different corners. In fact, you need to evaluate only three corners because the fourth corner is 0, 0 and cannot be the ultimate solution in maximizing profit. Just to summarize, then I can either draw as an objective function with the right slope and then see the last point it will touch, which is in this case is point B and evaluate the values of x1 and x2 at point B and calculate that profit or simply enumerate all corners, points A, B, and C, and pick the one that gives you the largest profit. So, going with the first method, we realized that B is the optimal solution, so how do we know what B is? How do we know the values of x1 and x2 at B? Basically, we have two equations: the equation for the labor and the equation for the clay. And these two equations, they intersect at this point. So at this point, both of these equations are equal to each other so that they satisfy each other. And therefore, I can solve two equations simultaneously and find the values of x and x1 and x2. [00:19:59:10] So if I go to my notepad again, this is how to draw the objective function to find the optimal solution, to find the optimal point. We find this point that the objective function touches last going outwards for maximization problem and then solve these equations simultaneously. So, to find the optimal point B, in this case, I have two equations: x1 +2x2 = 40 and 4x1 + 3x2 = 120. If you solve these two equations, for instance, you can multiply this equation by -4 and you add up exponent x1 from this side and x1 from the side will cancel and you end up with -5x2 = -40, which means that x2 = 8. And if you take this 8 and and plug it back in one of the equations, it will give you what x1 is so that's the value of x2 at point B and plug this in x1 + 2x8 = 40, which means that x1 = 24 and the value of x2 = 8. And from these, I can find what the profit value is, which is 40x24 + 8(50). I plug it back into Z, and that gives me 1360. That would be my profit for the point B, which is the intersection between the labor constraint and the material constraint. If I want to find the values of A and C, they are much easier because they are at the axes. So, in this value? This value corresponds to x1 = 0, right? I don't produce anything at point A.. I don't produce any of x1, but I produce everything of x2. So, if you plug this in the labor constraint of x1, plug them in here, I will end up with x1 = 0, so 2x2 = 40, which means that x2 = 20. You plug this back into the objective function, you will end up with a z of 1000. So, this is how we got the values for this point and the same thing here, the value here for x2 = 0, so x2 = 0 and x1 = 30. You plug this in the equation, the clay constraint, and you will find the value of x1 when x2 = 0. [00:24:00:02] And the profit will be 1200, so as you can see, we know it has been proven mathematically that the optimal solution is going to be on one of the corners. Which corner? I have three corners. I can evaluate three of them and this is what we did here. It was easier to find these values because they are right on the axis x1 and x2. In this case, we had to solve two simultaneous equations in this case for point B. I had to solve two equations simultaneously, and I found the values of x1 and x2, and they have actually the maximum profit. You can go back and take any combination that you want, any feasible combination of x1 and x2, and you will never get a value higher than 1360 profit. So that is the optimal solution. So again, to summarize, we can either just draw an objective function with a at the right slope and move it outwards until I touch the last corner point in the feasible region. And that would be my optimal solution. You don't have to evaluate anything else, or you can just evaluate all of the corners and find the optimal, the best profit, basically. So that's how I find the optimal solution among all possible solutions whenever I have a linear programming problem that can be represented by the graphical method. [00:25:30:26] Now one thing I want to point out is the coefficients in the objective function, they are very important because they may affect where the optimal solution ends up being, which corner. So, for instance, if I change the coefficients of the objective function to 70 and 20 instead of 40 and 50, in other words, now it's much more profitable to produce x1 than x2. It's much more profitable to produce bowls than mugs. So, clearly the slope of the objective function will change. So, as you can see here, this solid line represents the objective function. So, this is z and the arrow that you see here, it's just an indication that we are moving this objective function outwards. So, as you can see now, I have a different slope because now the coefficient for x1 = 70 and x2 = 20. You can follow the same process, you pick arbitrary value and you plot the objective function and then you can move it parallel to the line that you find, parallel to this solid line and you move it forward. The last point that this objective function will touch actually is point C in this case. If you notice when they the objective function was not as steep as this one point B was the last one. [00:27:00:24] So originally, the objective function of 40 and 50 for coefficients of x1 and x2, respectively, they were they would go from, let's say, we plotted, if you recall, at 20 16, it was like this slope and if we move outwards in parallel, if I move this in parallel, point B is going to be the last point I touch going outwards. This is going to be the last point I touch. Now when I change the slope, to this slope, now the last point, if I’m going outwards is not B anymore, it is C and it makes sense because now it's expected that x1 has a higher profit, which means that I will make more of x1 product than x2 because I make more money out of it. So, it's important to see here how the slope of the objective function may actually switch the optimal solution from one corner to another. You can try this exercise where you reverse the coefficient. So x1 make it the coefficient of x1 make it 20, while the coefficient of x2 is 70 and you will see that the slope of the objective function will become flatter, so the objective function will be flatter, maybe something like this and then at a certain point, the last point that it will touch would be point A and that becomes the optimal solution. So, as you can see, the optimal solution is not necessarily – it’s fixed per set of coefficients or parameters, and it can be sensitive to the objective function coefficients. More on this topic will be discussed in the future. One last concept is the standard format and the concept of slack variables. The standard format of linear programs requires that all constraints be in the form of equations. Ok, equalities instead of inequalities. So, I'll have an equal sign and to add an equal sign to the constraints with less than or equal to, we add something called a slack variable. So, in other words if I go back to my model right here in order for me to make this with an equal sign, I will have to carry the difference in some variable. So, if I have x1 + x2, eventually I want this to be equal to 40. If I add a variable, let's call it s1 that will carry anything left over in case I have unused labor or unused material. So, usually the slack variable refers to unused resources. [00:30:27:05] So for instance, if I produce 10 and 10 of x1 and x2 respectively, I will have 10 plus 20. That's 30. And where do I carry the unused resources? I will put them in the Slack variable or s1, so I will have another 10 here in an s1 and that will make it equal to 40. Whenever I put the inequalities, I convert them to equalities, I will have to, in case of less than or equal to, I will have to add a slack variable. And you can imagine if I have greater than or equal to, I will have different variable that I will subtract, which is called surplus. So, the slack variable carries the unused resources and the Slack variable contributes nothing to the objective function, it's not part of the objective function, it's just an imaginary variable that does not exist in the real problem, so that I know how much unused material is left. So, in our example, this would be the standard format of the linear program we have. As you can see, we added slack variables that will carry the unused labor and unused material into them. So, they are not negative variables; they don't contribute anything to the objective function. [00:32:07:24] So they have coefficients of 0 and 0 in the objective function. But they are useful in a sense that they will tell us how much more material is left. To reflect this on the graph. If we evaluate the solution at point A., and at point A x1 = 0, in other words, I don't produce any bowls, but I produce all mugs. At that point I have x1 = 0 and this will make x2 = 20. The unused labor at that point is saved in s1 or stored in s1, and it will be 0 so that the labor constraint becomes a binding constraint. It's the constraint that all of the resources use. However, the material constraint I have left over of 60, so if you plug in x1 = 0, x2 = 20 into the the labor constraint over here, I will have nothing in s1, it will be it will be 0. But the s2 I will be left with the same values and the second constraint for the s2 to I'll be left with pounds of clay. [00:33:41:15] However, and when I move to another point, let's say if I move to point C and evaluate point C, the values of x1 and x2 will be 30 and 0, respectively. And if you plug them into these constraints the material, the labor and material constraint, I will end up with 0 material left, but I have 10 hours left at this point. At the optimal solution. We have we have 0 and 0 material left and it makes sense because any material that I use will produce profits. So, it makes sense to maximize the usage of all the material that I have and then an optimal solution I found that the slack variables are equal to 0. In other words, nothing is left because I converted everything to a profit. That's not in general necessarily the case, but in many cases you will see that the resources, if all of the resources are used, I can find the optimal solutions. In more general models. I may have an optimal solution where slack variables may have some values because of other constraints and because of a mix of greater than or less than or equal to constraints.",5694,"[ 0.00581597  0.00399096  0.00277261 ... -0.00136959 -0.00802872

Graphical Method for Linear Programming Minimization Model,2.4,LPGS,"Title: Graphical Method for Linear Programming Minimization Model; Description: Graphical Method for Linear Programming Minimization Model; Transcript: Let's now take a minimization problem to demonstrate how the graphical solution method would work with minimization problems. Suppose that we have two brands of fertilizers available to us Super Grow and Crop Quick, and they both include two ingredients: the nitrogen and phosphate, and the field requires 16lbs of nitrogen and 24lbs of phosphate, regardless which type you use. So that's a constraint. That's a requirement that we need to have at least 16 pounds of nitrogen and 24lbs of phosphate, then we need to meet the cost of the Super Grow fertilizer is $6 a bag, while the cost of the Crop Quick is $3 a bag. So, our objective is to define or to decide how much of each brand we should purchase to minimize the total cost. The amount of nitrogen available in the Super Grow brand is 2lbs a bag and a bag will also include 4lbs of phosphate at a cost of $6 a bag. The second brand includes 4lbs of nitrogen and 3lbs of phosphate at a cost of $3 a bag. Regardless where the nitrogen is coming from, the first brand or the second brand, the field requires 16lbs of nitrogen and 24lbs of phosphate, so it's up to us to decide how many bags of each type we want to buy as long as we can meet this requirement, which is 16lbs of nitrogen and 24lbs of phosphate. So, to start our formulation, let's first define our decision variables. If I define x1 to be the number of bags of Super Grow and x2 is the number of bags of Crop Quick, then my objective would be to minimize the total cost, and that cost per bag, $6 of the first type, x1. So, if I buy x1 bags of Super Grow, it means that my cost of Super Grow would be 6x1 + the bags of Crop Quick x2 the number of bags multiplied by the cost per bag will give me the total cost of Crop Quick. Note that, I may end up buying a combination of x1 and x2. I may end up all buying all x1 or all x2 as long as I meet the minimum requirement of nitrogen and phosphate, which are included in the two brands, but at different ratios. So, these are the constraints that I need to respect. Basically, the nitrogen constraint is that I have to have a minimum of 16lbs of nitrogen regardless where this nitrogen is coming from. So, if it was coming from x1, if I use the first brand, the number of bags, each bag will include 2lbs of nitrogen, so the total amount of nitrogen would be 2*the number of bags I buy from this brand + 4lbs of nitrogen if I buy x2 bags of the second brand, so that would be the nitrogen constraint. The phosphate constraint similarly would be the amount of phosphate available per bag in the first brand. So, if I buy x1 of Super Grow and I have 4lbs of phosphate per bag, it means that I have a total amount of phosphate coming from the first brand for 4x1. And similarly, if I buy x2 bags of the second brand and each bag will contain 3lbs of phosphate, then I will have 3x2 phosphate as a total coming from the second brand. The total amount of phosphate that's coming from both brands must be greater than or equal to 24. So, these constraints don't necessarily enforce which brand to use as long as they are getting their minimum amount of nitrogen or phosphate. And of course, the last constraint is the non-negativity constraint, where the number of bags must be zero or above. You cannot have negative bags. So, the compact model, the mathematical formulation or the OR model, the linear programming model will be minimizing the cost z, which is 6x1 + 3x2, where x1 and x2 are the number of bags of brand one and two, respectively. And the constraints are the 2x1 + 4x2 greater than 16, which is the nitrogen constraint and 4x1 + 3x2, which is the phosphate constraint amounts coming from both brands must be greater than or equal to 24. It is common to write the formulation in this form without defining next to it what each constraint is. And then after the model, or before it, you explain basically what each constraint is and what each decision variable is. And finally, this is the non-negativity constraint. So, this is my mathematical model that would minimize the cost and respects these two constraints of nitrogen and phosphate. So, if I want to use the graphical method, I start with the constraints. S my first constraint is 2x1 + 4x2 greater than or equal to 16. In order to plot this line, I pretend that this greater than or equal to now becomes an equal sign. And I will plot this line. Basically if x1 for the first constraint, when x1 = 0, what is the equation going to be used to? It will be 4x2 = 16 and therefore x2 = 4. And so that would give me one point, which is right here. And the second point, if the opposite, if x2 = 0 then 2x1 = 16, and therefore x1 = 8, and that gives me my second point. And then I will connect these two points and it will give me this second line. In a similar way, you can set x1 = 0, and that gives you the value of x2. And you can set x2 = 0, and that gives you the value of x1 and you can plot this line. Now, keep in mind that this problem is a minimization problem, so the feasible region is not going to be the intersection over here. It will be the area that you see over here. So, how do we know that? First of all, from the constraints you noticed that the 2x1 + 4x2 is greater than or equal to 16, this line is the equation itself and anything greater than this line will go in this direction. Now, to make sure that you don't pick the wrong direction, you can just try any point in either side of the line. So, for instance, if I pick the point 6 and 6 from x1 and x2, so 6 and 6 would be somewhere here, and if you plug in 6 and 6 in the first constraint, so if I try 6 from x1 and 6 from x2, this means that I will end up with 12 + ((4*6) = 24) and that gives me 36, and 36 is actually greater than 16, so it is in the feasible region. So, the point that I picked in the feasible region, so I know that it is in this direction where my feasible region is and it's not in the opposite direction. Similarly, you can try another point for the second constraint, and you will see that this point will point in this direction as well. So, the feasible region goes this way. And you can try again the points 6 and 6 and plug it into this constraint, so it will be, for instance, here if I try 6 and 6, I will have 4(6) + 3(6) for x1 and x2 and that gives me6 0, which is also greater than 24. Now there is no specific rule why I choose 6 and 6, just pick any point on either side of the line and decide whether it's feasible or infeasible. If it turns out to be infeasible, then the opposite direction is the feasible region. So, in other words, if you end up taking a point over here, you can try it in both constraints and you will see that at this point is infeasible. And therefore, the opposite side of the constraint is the feasible region. So, the shaded area is the common area between both constraints. So, this area over here is not feasible for both constraints. It is only feasible for the first constraint, but not the second constraint. So, the shaded area is basically my feasible region over here. So, now that we decided on our feasible region, now we need to plot our objective function. And to plot our objective function, you can pick just any point. You can take the objective function and make it equal to any value. It is good practice to pick a value that's convenient to work with. So, if I set this, let's say if I set it to, if I said it to 24, for instance, it means that when x1 = 0, x2 = 8, and when x2 = 0 x1 = 4. So, if I plot this point of 4 and 8, that gives me the slope of the objective function. Do you see this objective function right here? You could have picked something else? So, for instance, you can try on your own to set it to equal to 36, for instance, and you will end up with this line. So, the slope of this line is basically 8/4, which is 2. So, any other value must give you a different line, but with the same slope. So, for instance, this line will have the same slope of 12/6, the same as 8/4, by trying maybe 36. And you can plot the objective function this way. Now, at this point, we have not yet decided what the optimal solution is yet. We need to move the objective function, since this is a minimization problem, inwards. In other words, closer to the direction of the 0. This is a minimization problem, so, the minimum value is 0; to have a cost of 0, that's the best thing. But, because of the constraint we cannot achieve, or we cannot use, the 0 because it's going to be infeasible. In other words, if I use 0 and 0, basically you are not buying any of the fertilizers and the field is not going to receive any of the nitrogen or the phosphate. So, I have to buy some so that I meet the requirement, but I want to buy the amounts that will give me the minimum cost. If you move this objective function towards the 0 point, since this is a minimization problem, and identify the point that it touches last in the feasible region as it goes inwards. So, if I look at this animation, Point A would be the last point it will pick. The objective function will touch the feasible region and that becomes my optimal solution. So again, here is the animation showing you that if you move this parallel inwards, it will actually touch Point A last. It's not going to be Point B or Point C, and that gives me the minimum cost. If you calculate the values of x1 and x2, basically this is easy to calculate because x1 is 0 in this case and x2 will end up being 8. That gives me a cost of 24, and it will meet the requirement. So, try to plug in x1 and x2 of 0 and 8 into the constraints and see that you will meet the requirement. Another way that you can define where your optimal point is that the optimal solution is going to have to be on this corner, this corner, or this corner at these vertices is the optimal solution. So, it's one of these three possible solutions. So, another way to do it is basically to calculate what x1 and x2 at this point are, and at this point also and at this point, evaluate Z and then decide which one is the lowest and that will become my minimum cost. So, it's important to know which directions we would direction, we move the objective function, and if it was a minimization problem, we want to go in this direction this way. And if it's a maximization problem, I want to go this way. So, in this case, we're minimizing the cost. So, the direction we move in is what you see here, in this way. We also have a term that we use to put the mathematical program in standard format, it's called surplus variables, and they are basically variables that we subtract from a constraint from the from the left-hand side of the constraint whenever we have a greater than or equal to constraint. So, if I have a greater than or equal to, it means that I have a minimum requirement to meet, and a surplus variable is a variable that will be subtracted from that constraint to convert it to an equal sign. And a surplus variable represents an excess above the minimum requirement. So, when we subtract a constraint from when we subtract the variable from a constraint, it represents an excess above the minimum requirements. So, we need a minimum of 16lbs of nitrogen. If I subtract any value that I have in s1, for instance, it will show you how much more above the minimum limit that you are getting in that in that solution, and it contributes nothing to the objective function. It's a dummy variable that just basically holds the difference between the minimum requirement and the solution. So, if you end up with 24 lbs or, let's say, 20lbs of nitrogen, it means that you are 4lbs above the minimum and that 4lbs will be stored in s1, which represents the amount above the minimum requirement of nitrogen in this case. So, when we subtract this variable from the constraint, it will store a net, whatever difference above the minimum requirement, and that's called the surplus variable. In maximization problems and or in constraints where we have less than or equal to sign, it represents the unused resources that are left over and there will be a + sign instead of a - sign here. So, a surplus variable is similar to a slack variable, except that a surplus variable is used with a greater than or equal to sign, which usually it's a minimum requirement that we need to meet, and we need to give it a negative sign here so that it will carry the amount above the minimum requirement and in the slack slack variables it will basically store in it the amount of unused resources, and it will have a plus sign over here. So, the standard format in linear programming is to make these equal signs using this the surplus or the slack variables. In this case, we're going to use the surplus variables because we have a minimum requirement to meet. As you can see here, they contribute nothing to the objective function. And I added this s1 and s2 with a negative sign to the left-hand side of the constraint so that I make this an equal sign and all of these variables are negative. All of these variables are non-negative. So s1, when it is not negative, it means it's a positive. It has a positive value in it or a 0. Then it will make this constraint an equality. So, if we look at our solution here in the standard format, if you look at the optimal solution, which is A, x1 = 0 and x2 = 8, as we've seen before. If you plug in 0 and 8, you will see that the s1 plug in 0 and 8 and this constraint, you will have to buy 0., That’s 0, 4*8 = 32 …32 is 16 units above the minimum requirement of 16. So, in order for this to be equal to 16, s1 must take the value of 16. So, we are above the minimum requirement of 16. So, in other words, I'm not adding only 16 pounds of nitrogen, I'm adding 32 pounds, which is double the minimum requirement. And I don't have any amount of phosphate in the optimal solution above the minimum requirements. So, I'm still meeting the minimum requirement of phosphate, but nothing above that. And Point B, which is not an optimal solution, by the way, I have nothing above the minimum requirement. I have 0 and 0 in the surplus variables, and that's the solution that you get for Point B, a fractional solution. And to give these values, you take the equation of this constraint and the equation of this constraint and you simultaneously solve these two equations and you find these values and, note here that although x1 and x2 are 0s, that's not an indication that this is an optimal solution. Actually, there is nothing additional than the minimum requirement in this particular point that you are putting in the field. You are just meeting the minimum requirement and not at the optimal cost. The optimal cost is 24 over here and the cost over here is 33.6. The same thing for C the solution x1 is 8 bags of the first fertilizer and 0 of the second fertilizer. That gives me 8lbs of phosphate above the minimum requirement of 24, but at a much higher cost, which is the 48. So, my optimal solution clearly is here and the surplus variables tells us how much more of each material I have above the minimum requirements. This format, whenever you put it in using surplus variables or slack variables in case of less than or equal to sign, will be the standard format.",3638,"[ 0.01042119 -0.00228134  0.00585169 ... -0.00281502 -0.00288833

In some cases, we may encounter some irregular types of linear programming problems where you may have multiple optimal solutions and feasible solutions and unbounded solutions -- three different cases -- and we will discuss each one separately. In the first case, as you can tell from the title, when you have multiple optimal solutions, it means that you have more than one solution with the same value of the objective function. So, in this example, suppose that the objective function is given in this form: $40x1 + 30x2 and I have to meet these constraints, and the graphical methods show us where the feasible region is, which is the shaded area over here. And when you plot the objective function, you will see that as you maximize -- and the objective function will go outwards away from the zero -- it may hit points B and point C simultaneously. In fact, if you evaluate the solution at point B and point C, you see that you have two different solutions: 24 for x1 and 8 for x2 versus 30 for x1 and 0 for x2. But both have the same value of objective function. In this case, basically, we come across a problem where you have more than one optimal solution. If you track the objective function and you see how it actually moves outwards from the zero point, you will notice that it actually went all the way and it hit points B and C at the same time, because the objective function slope is parallel to the slope of this constraint on which point B and C fall. [00:02:10:14] So, when you have a case like this and one of the constraints is parallel to the objective function, and it happens that that constraint contains the corners on which the optimal solution will fall. You will end up with a case like this with multiple optimal solutions. In fact, it's not only B and C are optimal. You have infinite number of optimal solutions -- any linear combination of x1 and x2 that falls on the line B, C will be an optimal solution. Of course, you will end up with fractional values, and that's OK because that's one of the requirements for linear programming to work. You have to be able to accept fractional values. So, in a case like this, I have multiple optimal solutions. And that's a good situation because if you have so many optimal solutions to choose from, this will allow you to optimize with respect to some other criterion. So, for instance, if you're maximizing the profit and you realize that you have so many ways of achieving the same profit, in this case, I have… [00:03:19:11] …I can produce different values for x1 and x2, but end up with the same amount, 1200. It means that I can now consider some other aspects I consider. I can consider whether I want to produce, whether I want to make my facility produce only one type of products or not. I can consider the schedule for my employees. I can consider some other requirements that I want to optimize in addition to the profit, because I can achieve the same profit with many different solutions. So that's one unusual case. It's not very common, but it happens. Another situation is where you have infeasible problems. Infeasible problems are problems where you have a violation for at least one of the constraints. You don't have to violate all of the constraints. If you violate only one of the constraints, that means that you have an infeasible problem. So, in this example, where I have these constraints that I need to consider, if you look at the feasible region, if you plot this, you realize that you have part of the feasible region on this side, which is the shaded area. And then another part on the other side here where you see this small triangle and in this case, basically it is as if we're asking the linear program to satisfy this feasible region and this feasible region simultaneously… [00:04:50:28] …and that's not possible. And this is when we get an infeasible problem. Usually, infeasible problems are due to possibly an error in the formulation or not being realistic with your constraints. So, you may model your constraints in a way that makes the problem very restricted and the constraints are unrealistic. So, you need to go back and revisit the model, revisit your assumptions, and see if you can relax the constraints to some degree or remove some of the constraints to make it feasible. If not, then basically your answer is that there is no feasible solution for the problem. As I said, typically you have an over-constraint problem or you may have made an error in the in the model. The third case is when you have unbounded problems and unbounded problems are a situation where the objective function can increase indefinitely. So, if we take this example where you have this objective function and you're maximizing so you will be moving in this direction where you see the arrow and I have two constraints x1 must be greater than or equal to 4. So, this line represents the first constraint that I have to be on the right-hand side of this constraint must be greater than or equal to 4, and x2 must be less than or equal less than or equal to 2. [00:06:21:02] So that's my x2 constraint, my the second constraint, and I need to be below this line. So, you see the feasible region here. The shaded area is the feasible region. So, as you maximize, you need to move away from the zero and you're going in that direction. Clearly, you can go to infinity; you can increase this objective function indefinitely. And that's not realistic, either. This is something similar to maximizing profit for a production facility and not putting constraints on the amount of resources that you have. For instance, you don't have infinite resources, so you cannot have infinite profit. In this kind of problem, again, it could be very likely that you have an error in the model or you have just missed some of the constraints and that you should have included in your model so that you have something to limit this feasible region and put a limit on it so that you finally hit a border line and not go indefinitely. These three types of irregular Linear programming problems are possible. Then you may encounter them, but they are a little unusual. For most cases, you don't see this this kind of problem, but sometimes you may and you need to be aware of that.",1604,"[ 0.01190229  0.00817055  0.00019651 ...  0.00368264 -0.01271411

Computer Solutions for Linear Programming Formulations,3.1,CSLP,"Title: Computer Solutions for Linear Programming Formulations; Description: Computer Solutions for Linear Programming Formulations; Transcript: We've discussed in this module how to implement a formulation, a mathematical formulation for a linear program in a computer modeling environment. First, let's remember that we first need to frame the problem conceptually before we start implementing a computer model. And that can be done by first defining our decision variables. Our objective function and constraints. Then the next step is to formulate a mathematical model by hand. To make sure we capture the objective function and the constraints in terms of the decision variables. The problem can be minimizing or maximizing an objective function to subject to the constraints. Then we put the model in standard format or standard form, and we will talk a little more about this. And once we have that, we can implement the model in a computer language and there are many computer languages or environments out there. We will be using Excel as most people are familiar with that environment. And then once we have the formulation done in Excel or implemented in Excel, we solve the problem using a solver. And in this case, we will use Excel Solver again just to remind you of the standard form. The standard form of linear programs requires that we put all the variables on the left hand side of the grid or the the the inequality sign. And on the right hand side, we put the constants. So for instance, if I have x one x two x three decision variables and I have a constraint that looks like this, to put it in a standard form, we need to move all of the decision variables to the left hand side and put on the right hand side just the constant or the.

In this case, it is a zero or any other number that doesn't include any variables. Another example, if I have an issue like this, I don't want to leave. I don't want to have ratios of decision variables in my model. So if I simplify this inequality, it becomes like this form. And then I can break it down and move all my decision variables to the left hand side and leave on the right hand side. The constant, the right hand side. We don't have to have zero all the time. It may have it may happen to have. You may have happened to have some other values. It doesn't have to be zero, but for sure, we don't want to have ratios of decision variables and we want to have all of our decision variables on the left hand side. So let's although some solvers and modeling environments, they have the ability to have non-standard format. Let's just make sure that our LP model, whether it's the mathematical model or the computer model, is implemented in a standard form by putting their decision variables on the left hand side and that the constants on the right hand side.

Now, before we get into the computer modeling, it's worth mentioning how these models, once they are implemented and solved, using the computer, what the computer does in the background. The first method that was developed to solve such formulations is called the simplex method. And this method is probably the first method to be used for linear programming, and it's basically an algorithm of an algorithm that which is basically a set of steps that a computer program can execute and then find a solution. If you recall in the graphical method, we know that the the decision, the optimal solution is to find the decision variable values for the corner points in the feasible region. And if you can imagine a computer program that has an algorithm implemented in it that will evaluate the different corners of that feasible region and then pick the one that has the optimal value, then that would be considered an algorithm, a numerical algorithm. So the simplex method is a sequence of steps or an algorithm that's implemented in a computer algorithm and that becomes a LP solver. So and in our case, the simplex method steps have been implemented in a solvent that can be used within Excel. And there are many other packages other than Excel that have this capability. In this course, we focus on modeling rather than on the solution method itself. So we will assume that the simplex method is there for us to solve the problem, and we will spend more time modeling problems and solving them with the computer instead of solving them by hand using the simplex method.

There are plenty of resources available on the Simplex method. A simple internet search will lead you to many resources that explains the method and its very important method, but the focus of the course will be rather here on modelling rather than on the solution method itself. So let's take an example to show how we implement this in a computer language. This is an example of maximizing maximization problem where we are producing two products both on mugs and the only resources that are used in this process are the clay and labor, and the profit per bowl is $40 and the profit per mug is $50. We need four pounds of clay to make a bowl and three pounds of clay to make a mug. However, we need one hour of labor to make a bowl and two hours of labor to make a mug. We have 40 hours of labor available and we have 120 pounds of clay available to us. And the question is how many bowls and mugs should we produce to maximize our profit? The formulation quickly. This is a simple problem. We first frame the problem and lay out our data. So these are our two products that eventually become our decision variables x one and X two.

This is the amount of labor required, the amount of clay required, and that's the profit you make by selling each type per unit. And the resources available are 44 labor and 124 clay, so you cannot exceed these resources in order to produce the two products. The objective is to maximize the profit. So it's forty dollars per bowl by the number of polls, plus fifty dollars per month multiplied by the number of months. Subject to the availability of labor and material. So it takes one hour to make a bowl and two hours to make a mug. But I cannot exceed a total of 40 hours. So if I multiply the time per unit by the number of bowls plus the time per unit, the time that I need per month multiplied by the number of months cannot exceed as a total forty hours and the same thing for the material, I cannot exceed 120 pounds. Both variables have to be non negative, so they have to be either zero or more. So that's my mathematical formulation, my next step is to implement this in a modeling language, in our case, we will use Excel. This is a snapshot of the solution, but I'm going to walk you through the Excel spreadsheet itself and and I start out by laying my data on this spreadsheet, organize it in a way that can be easily understood by you and other people who may have to review your work.

So these are my two products, and this is the profit per unit, and this is the amount of resources I need to produce bowls and mugs. So I need one hour to produce a bowl and two hours to produce a mug and four pounds of clay to produce a bowl and three pounds to produce a mug. The amounts that will need to produce our the decision variables, and I highlighted them here in these two cells. So what you see here is the optimal solution because this is the spreadsheet after we found the solution. So assuming that we don't know what the solution is, you can start with something like zero and zero. And what I connect these to. Decision variables where they have no formulas, no nothing other than just simply to blank cells, starting with two blank cells. I need to connect them to my objective and the objective here is to maximize profit. So the profit equation is implemented here. So what you saw in the slide of 40 x one plus 50 x two needs to implement it in this cell and this green cell. If I click on this formula, you will see that. I am multiplying the profit payable by the number of balls, plus the profit per month by the number of months, if I have zero and zero at this point in, my profit will be zero. But if I change these values, maybe to one and one, you will see that I have a profit of 90, which is 40 plus 50.

If I produce two of one of two balls and one month, then I will have a profit of 130 and so on. So our objective is to find what is the value of X1 and X2 in these two cells, such that this profit be maximized without exceeding the resources? Now my resources, how much I am using is implemented here. These are my two constraints. What you see here is my two constraints. And in this cell, it's an implementation of the first constraint where I multiply the amount of the coefficient of x one and the coefficient of X two of the value of X1 and X2, respectively. So I multiply this sell by this one, plus this sell by this one must not exceed or, in other words, less than or equal to the right hand side of 40. So the left hand side of the constraint is implemented in these two cells, and the right hand side will have only constants which are 4.20. And in my solver, as you will see in a minute, they I will set these two cells to be less than or equal to to these two cells. What you see here is basically just a nothing really implemented in terms of an equation, just for easier, for easier readability.

Here I put a less than or equal to less than or equal to so that you know that this is the left hand side of the constraint and this is the right hand side of the constraint. Anything left over, which is known as the slack, it will be calculated here. So if I don't produce anything, if I have zero on zero, then everything is left over. All of my resources are left over. However, if I produce something maybe like five and five, I will make $400, 50, $450 and I will have some leftover from my materials. So they they left over. Although it's not really part of the program at this point, however, it gives you some information about. How much resources are left and basically they are the difference between what's available and what has been used. So it's the difference between this cell and this cell for the first constraint and the difference between these two cells for the second constraint. And what you see here is just a snapshot of my mathematical model, so I can use it as a as a roadmap when I implement my when I implement my model. Now, to solve this, suppose that I start with zero and zero, so I don't really know the answer to this problem. I will go to my my data in 2010, in Excel 2010 and go to my solver. And when you click on Solver, it will bring up this window in which I will define where my objective decision, variable and constraints are.

So in this area, I will put I will select the. I would select my objective function, I put it here, which is my objective. I will decide whether it's maximization or minimization problem, so I will select max or min. And this in this case, it's a maximization problem. This value right here is if you have a case or a problem where you want the objective to be as close as possible to a specific value. So maybe you want your answer to be as close as possible to 100, then you can select this and type in 100 here. So in our case, for this example, it's a maximization problem. And my decision, my objective function is this cell that's activated, as you can see here. So if I didn't have anything here, I start by selecting this cell and that will set my objective over here. My decision variables are the the cells that I will select in order to have the program manipulate them, change them so that it will maximize the profit. So I selected basically this range. Of cells and the constraints are that the left hand side must be less than or equal to the right hand side, so the options that you have are less than equal to greater than or equal to integer binary or different then.

So for most, problems will be using in linear programming will be using the the less than or equal to or greater than or equal to in some. Once we get to the integer programming section, we will be talking about integers and binary. So that's my first constraint, and this is my second constraint. We have the left hand side must be less than or equal to the right hand side that you see activated on this sheet. So if I had nothing populated in this window, so if I go ahead and delete all of these as if I didn't, I started from scratch it. As you see, it will be very easy to to go back and plug this end. My objective is right here and it's a maximization problem and my decision variables are right here. I selected them and my constraints are that this constraint is less than or equal to this constraint. Then I will add. Another constraint where this one is less than or equal to this one. And then I can hit OK, I have one last constraint, which is the non negativity constraint. X1 and X2 must be greater than or equal to zero. And in this case, I can just select this option and it will do this in force. This constraint for me. Make unconstrained variables not negative. That's what can help me to make sure that X1 and X2 are not negative.

If another way of doing this is that you can select the decision variables themselves and make them greater than or equal to zero, and that will do the trick for you. You don't have to have both of them. You can have either one or the other, or you can have both. It doesn't matter. So I can go ahead and delete this. And then he'd solve. And that will give me an answer. And it's important that we pay attention to what the screen is telling me. Sometimes you may have a screen that will tell you the solution isn't feasible. Sometimes it may tell you I have a feasible solution, but I don't know whether it's an optimal one or not. So it's important to look at the result that solver gives you. In this case, it says Solver found the solution. All constraints and optimality conditions are satisfied. This means that Solver was able to find the optimal solution, and you have the choice of keeping that optimal solution on your spreadsheet. You can select the answer or the sensitivity reports, and that will generate two sheets, as you see on the spreadsheet. One will contain the values of the decision variables, the optimal values, and another one is useful for conducting sensitivity analysis, which we will use once we get to that topic for the time being. I will just hit OK. And it will give me the optimal values for X1 and X2.

So the optimal solution without violating the constraint is 24 balls and eight mugs, and that gives me 360 dollars of profit. Notice that I have nothing left over of the resources. Sometimes in an optimal solution, you may have something left over. It just happened in this case that I use all of my resources and which makes sense because the more resources I use, they translate directly to profits. But sometimes you may end up with a little bit of resource that's not enough to make a a unit, so you may have something left over in these in these cells. Once this spreadsheet was created when it was created, it created the Answer Report and the sensitivity report. We will be discussing this in greater detail in the sensitivity analysis section. But for now, what you see here is the report that solver will generate for you and the optimal solution. Is for this problem is 24 and eight, and this is a snapshot of the model, now you can go back to your graphical graphical solution technique and compare the solution you found there with the solution that the computer found, and that will be the solution to this. To this problem, we will be developing and implementing many of these models. So it's important that you be very familiar with Excel and you know how to plug in these equations and you know how to use solver as well.",3354,"[ 0.00918654  0.01244437  0.00121427 ...  0.00216969 -0.01137601

Linear Programming Applications - Election Survey 1,3.3,CSLP,"Title: Linear Programming Applications - Election Survey 1; Description: Linear Programming Applications - Election Survey 1; Transcript: [00:00:01:18] Let's take an application of election surveys in which a public relations firm has been contracted from a political party to conduct some interviews, and the interviews can be conducted by phone or in person, and the person can conduct 80 phone interviews or 40 interviews a person personal interviews in a single day. So in one day, a person can interview either 80 people over the phone or 40 people in person, and to make sure that the data is representative, the we need to meet these constraints. At least 3000 interviews must be conducted, 1000 interviews must be by phone, and 800 interviews must be in person. An interview must conduct only an interviewer must conduct only one type of interview, so once we we cannot mix tapes of interviews per individual per interviewer, so if they are assigned for interviews, they stick to it in one day. So this way, it will make the model easier to develop in terms of assigning people to interviews. And the cost is $50 per day for a foreign interviewer and $70 per day for personal interviewer. And the firm wants to know the minimum number of interviewers to hire in order to minimize cost. So the requirement for this problem is first to formulate a linear programming model and solve it graphically. Then we want to determine the sensitivity ranges for the daily cost of telephone interviewer and the number of personal interviews required. See, does the firm conduct any more telephone or personal and personal interviews more than required? And if so, by how many is the model going to say, generate more interviews than required? And what would be the effect on the optimal solution if the firm was required to increase the number of personal interviews conducted from 800 to 100? So our starting point here is to develop a the linear programming model, so I would start with defining decision variables in which X1 is defined as the number of phone interviewers. [00:02:47:04] And X2. Is the number of personal. Interviewers and since an interviewer will have to. Either do phone interviews for the whole day or personal interviews for the whole days, I don't have to worry about interviewers that will do a mix. And our objective is to minimize. The total cost and the cost is $50. Per day. By the number of interviewers, so if if I have if I hired X1 interviewers, each interviewer will conduct whole days of interviews and they will cost $50, and a phone interview will cost 70 dollars by the number of interviewers who will do personal interviews. The constraints that I have to meet are that I have to have a minimum of 3000 total interviews so a person can do 80 interviews per phone interview. So if I hire X1 people to conduct phone interviews, this means that they can perform 80 multiplied by x one. Plus, if I hire X2, they will do 40 interviews per day. The total amount of interviews must be. [00:04:15:07] At least 3000. The second requirement. The second requirement is that I have to have at least a thousand interviews done by phone. So again, if I hire 80, if I hire X1 interviewers, they can do 80. 80 interviews per day, this this 80 by the number of people I hire must be greater than or equal to a thousand. So this is the first constraint. This is the second constraint and the last constraint is that. The number of personal interviews must be greater than or equal to 800. I can do 40 per day by the number of interviewers extra, so that will give me 800. So that's my third constraint. And finally, X1 and X2 must be greater than. Or equal to zero? This is our formulation of the linear programming model, and the next step would be to solve this model graphically. So to solve this with the graphical method, as usual, we start defining our axis x one on the x axis and Y x two on the y axis. So if I have an if I have the scale done as 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and so on here. And I start with the first constraint where I have ATX one plus 4x to equal to 3000, I will pretend that this is an equal sign at this point and to plot this equation as usual. I said, let's say x two equal to zero, then x one would be 3000 divided by 80. [00:06:09:06] That gives me thirty seven point five. So when X two is equal to zero, when X two is equal to zero x one would be 37. Point five, so this would be one point, and when X one is zero extra would be 3000 divided by divide by 40, and that would give me 50. So this is my second point, and at this point, I can just draw that constraint. So this would be a constraint one. And since it's greater than or equal to zero, the feasible region will be in this direction. And you can try any point and see where the feasible region falls. And then the second constraint is ATX one is equal to 1000. So this is a straight line to a straight vertical line where X one would be equal to 1000 divided by 80. So 1000 divided by 80 that will give me 12 and a half, so I will add the 12 and a half mark over here. I will draw a line and maybe we can. He was a different color. That line ups not in this location, but in this location. That line will go like this and that would be the second constraint. And the feasible region for the second constraint is since this is greater than or equal to, it will be in this direction. And finally, the third constraint is 4x2 is equal to 800 that will be a horizontal line eight 800 divided by 40 will give me the value for X2, which in this case will be 20. [00:08:06:05] So and tow the tow point. And again, I can probably choose a different color. So at point one right here, I'm going to just draw a horizontal line and the feasible region would be in this. In this direction. Now I will plot the so the feasible region is right here, that's the common feasible region for all three constraints. Now if I want to plot the objective function, the objective function is 5X OnePlus 7T X2. Again, pick a reasonable number to work with, so let's say if you pick 3500. Arbitrary but convenient for calculations. If I pick 3500. So for to plot the. Ok. To plot there, suppose that I take the 5X OnePlus 7T X to. And said it to equal 3500. It means. That when X2 is equal to zero, when or when X1 is equal to zero, X2 will be 50. And when X two is equal to zero x one. It will be 70. So the objective function will be the connection between. The connection between X on the X 250. And on the X-1 70, so it will be something like this. In fact, maybe I can drag it out a little bit so that it doesn't look like one of the constraints. So in this case, my objective function is the line that goes through this. Ok, so that's my function, and remember that I'm minimizing so this. [00:10:33:15] Function will have to be going towards the zero, so that's the direction. And if I if you can imagine this line moving. So if this objective function, this is the feasible region and this objective function moves in this direction in parallel, I will hit this corner. Then if I keep going, that would be the last corner I will hit as I go towards zero because I'm minimizing. So again, that goes through 50 and 70 as it goes down this way, it hits one corner right here. So if this is a. If this is pointed right here and this is point B, these are potentially the. This is potentially the the the optimal solutions, either this corner or this corner and the as I move this objective function first, it will hit a and then if I continue, it will hit me and still feasible. So B is the optimal point. And to be on the safe side, you can calculate both values and plug them into the objective function to see which one gives you a smaller value. So if I try. Maybe we take the next page and if I try point a. So according to A. X1 is already clear that its 12 and a half. And if you plug this into the constraint 80 by 12 and a half plus 40 X2. Gives me 3000. It means that extra is equal to 50 and in a case like this. [00:12:27:08] When X1 is twelve and a half and X two is fifty z, you plug in the numbers into the objective function that gives you 4000 125. If I look at problem at point B point B X two, it's clear that it's tiny and x eighty x one. Plus, 40 participated by toe will be equal to 3000. And this means that X1 is equal to seven point five and Z for this for this point. It will be if you plug it into the objective function to be two to 277. Five. So clearly that the. Optimal cost, the minimum, optimal cost. So over here, point point A. Is X one equals to twelve point five x two equals to 50, and Z is equal to four one two five. While Point B. So that's point a while, point B right here, this corner. So if I point to it, B would be the 27. And a half for X one and four x two, it's the twenty and twenty and four z, it will be the two seven seven five and that would be my optimal solution using the graphical method. And this requirement we require to determine the sensitivity range for the daily cost of phone interviews and the number of personal interviews. So we need to decide on the sensitivity range for the coefficients in the objective function before the optimal solution will change. In other words, if I look back at this figure. I'm trying to determine by how much I can rotate the Z function, rotating, changing the coefficients of the Z function means really rotating it one way or the other. [00:14:52:04] So by how much I can rotate the Z function, the dashed line that you see here before the optimal solution switches from one point to another. At this point, the optimal solution is point B. If I drag this in parallel, like this minimizing towards the zero, this is my optimal, my current optimal point. So with deciding the range on the coefficients, it means that I buy how much I can change the coefficient in the objective function, which is really the cost before the solution switches from being point A to point B. Now, if you imagine going rotating this this way, if I rotate this this way until it is parallel to the first constraint, so it's as if it is parallel, the Z function is parallel to this constraint. At this point, the objective function will match exactly this constraint. It would be on the same slope. Any additional rotation of Z will make the the objective function or the optimal solution switch from point A to point A.. So if I make it exactly parallel, both A and B are optimal and any additional rotation, like if we rotated just a little bit more, then if you if you actually keep going towards the zero with this objective function, the optimal point. So if I rotated just a little bit more for demonstration purposes, if I have, I minimized, the optimal point is no longer b. [00:16:35:01] It's going to be a as you can see, I can go deeper into the feasible region and this way the optimal solution becomes a. So I'm going to put it back at the same way, it was a connecting point seventy and fifty. And again, what I'm trying to determine is by how much I actually can rotate this objective function, how much I can accomplish this by changing the coefficient of X one or the coefficient of X two. If we, let's say, take the phone interviews and change the coefficient for that, I want to see by how much I can rotate this objective function before the optimal solution changes from B to A. In other words, before the Z function. Becomes parallel to constraint one. And if they are parallel, it means that they have the same slope. So again, I'm trying to rotate this until it is parallel to the first constraint. And this way and b both are optimal. If I rotate it a little bit more like this point a becomes the optimal solution, not point B. As you can see in this demonstration, if I slide past point B 2.8 and that becomes my optimal solution. Now to translate this mathematically. But this back, the way it same way it was. And I'm going to do a slow. I'm going to make the slope of Z equal to the slope of one and keep that coefficient as a variable so that I know by how much the coefficient for X one needs to change. [00:18:18:05] So let's do. This calculation right here, so this is Part B, the slope for Z. Ok, first, Z is equal to 50 x one. Plus, 70 x two, if I look at the X two as being my y axis. To calculate the slope for the objective function, then X two would be equal to z divided by 70 minus 50 divided by 70 x one. And that is the the. Current slope as I represent this, just think of X2 as being my wife and X1 is being my ex, that becomes my coefficient. That coefficient that I circulated in red becomes my, becomes my slope. So now if I calculate so this is the slope for the Z function and if I calculate the slope for constraint one. I have I would have X equals to 3000 minus 80 x1 and X2 would be 75 minus 20 x one. So. This is the slope for the constraint, and if I make these two equal, but leaving the coefficient for x one as a variable so that I. Figure out this point at which they become both parallel, then minus C one divided by 70, so as if this point. Ok. Becomes my C one, so minus C one equals to minus 20. And this means that C one is equal to 140. [00:20:27:17] Remember that I can change the the slope of the Z function by either increasing the value for the coefficient of X1 or by reducing the value for the coefficient of X2. In this case, I'm increasing the value of the coefficient of X1, which is C one. So C one in this way would be 140. In other words, to to get to that point where I switch optimal solution from B to A.. This can go all the way up to 140 without switching the optimal solution at any point that this becomes more than 140. It means that Point A becomes the optimal solution. If you look back at this graph changing the coefficient for X1 all the way to 140, it means that this it means that this will be will hit all the way up and 140 on the X2 axis. Because when X1 is equal to when X1 is equal to when the C one, the option for X1 hit the 140. That's when these two when these two become parallel. The Z function and the constraint one and any additional rotation. So at this point, these will be parallel. Maybe I rotated it a little bit more because remember, I'm doing not doing this very accurately. So these are now parallel at any point in time. I rotate this a little bit more like this, then point A will become my optimal solution. So in other words, this coefficient of C of X1 to C one can go all the way to to 140, and the optimal solution doesn't change. [00:22:24:12] Anything above 140 will change the optimal solution. What about rotating it the opposite way? How far can I rotate it before it changes, before c one changes to by how much I can decrease it? In other words, how if I make, if I reduce the value for a C one, it can go all the way down to zero. It can go all the way down to zero without changing the optimal solution. In other words, the slope for Z can become horizontal. Ok, if if if I rotate this all the way. So remember, the optimal solution is right here at this point. Ok. It's going through point B if I rotate this, if I keep rotating this. So if the object, the function is here, but it is, as you slide it down, it will go through B if I rotate this all the way, all the way until it is actually horizontal with slope of zero. I still do not change optimal solutions. The optimal solution would still be point B as I minimize. So in other words. In other words, the. They are the range for C one C one can range from zero to 140. And the optimal solution doesn't change, so I can rotate this objective function. I can rotate this objective function all the way. I make it steeper all the way where it becomes parallel to to this constraint so it can go. [00:24:17:19] It can go all the way up there, and it will. Until that point, it will switch when SEA one is equal to 140, the coefficient for X one becomes equal to 140. This is when the optimal solution switch from B to A.. However, if I rotate this the opposite way, regardless how much I rotated, even when the slope is zero, the optimal solution? Imagine that this is your z. It will keep going down, down, down, down. And that would be the last point to hit in minimization, which is point B. In other words, the the objective function, the optimal solution doesn't change even if I reduce this c one all the way down to zero. If I want to do so, let's put this back the same way it was so that we can run this exercise. So this was my original. This was my original plot. So now we understand, hopefully that how we got to this range of C one, I can rotate it in one way all the way when until this coefficient is 140 or I can reduce it all the way to zero and it would not affect the optimal solution, anything above 140. Obviously, I cannot do less than zero, but anything above 140 will change the optimal solution from point B to point A.. So now let's try to do the same exercise for the personal interviews. For the personal interviews where let's start a new page where if I take the slope for Z, so for the personal interviews. [00:26:14:05] X1 again, is equal to Z minus 72 x two, and this means that X1 is equal to Z divided by 50 minus 70 over 50. X two. And the first constraint which goes through points A and B is 80. X one. So the slope over here. For the Z is 70 minus 70, over 50 and the slope for the first constraint 80 x one plus. Plus 4x2. Equals 3000. This means that X1 is equal to 37 point five minus one half extra. When you simplify this, so the constraint here, the slope for the constraint is minus one over two. And similar analysis can be done where I have C2 over 50. Is equal now on manipulating the coefficient for X2 is equal to minus one over two, which means that C two will be equal to this is minus here. C two would be equal to 12. Ok. C two would be equal to 25. It means this means that I can reduce C two. I can reduce C to and this objective function by 25, which means it will be it can go all the way down to 45 before the optimal solution changes. Remember that I can make this objective function steeper or flatter, either by changing the coefficient for x one or four x two. We did it for X one for X two if I reduce the coefficient for X two all the way down to 45. [00:28:21:11] So in other words, I reduced it by 25 units. I would. I still wouldn't. I would still be parallel to this constraint and the same the optimal solution remains the same. Anything less than 45. Or if I reduce it by more than 25, then the optimal solution will switch. In other words, at that point, the the rotation, as I did it earlier will take place and you switch you increase that rotation by a little bit and you'll switch from the optimization being point B to point A.. The rotation can be accomplished by changing either C one or two. How about if we rotate this the other way around? If we don't take this the other day, if we change C2, even if we make this, even if we make this. The slope of Z to infinity. If I rotated enough to make it vertical, even if I make it a rotated enough to be vertical, in other words, the the the slope will be infinity, that optimal solution. That optimal solution is not going to let me let me explain this a little bit more, so if I put this back the same way it was OK. And if I, if I had my optimal solution was at point B right here. And we said, if I if I rotate this by reducing the coefficient for X two, I can I can hit the value of 45 before the optimal solution changes if I rotate this, even if it gets to a vertical point, in other words, this way. [00:30:16:27] Even where this the slope for vertical line is infinity, the optimal solution would still remain the same. So it doesn't, really doesn't really change. So if I'm at that point kept rotating, rotating, rotating until it became until it became vertical. The optimal solution does not does not change. The and Point B remains optimal, so in with respect to with respect to let's put this back the same way it was with respect to. The equation here with respect to the equation for the objective function. In other words, if even if I increase the coefficient, the the coefficient for X by a large amount, it's not going to affect the optimal solution you can. You are the optimal solution remains the same. However, if I reduce that, I can reduce it only to 45 before it changes. Optimal solution. So if I want to summarize this here, so they range for C2. Will be can go all the way down to 45, and even if it goes all the way up to infinity, the optimal solution is not going to change. So this is the sensitivity range for for the for the personal interviews. And Part C, does the firm conduct more interviews, phone interviews and personal interviews than required because of the constraints, the nature of the constraints we have and how many more, if that's the case? To address this issue, if you look back at the graph here, remember that Point B is the optimal solution. [00:32:15:08] And this is these are the three constraints. Now, if you look at this constraint, for instance, the vertical constraint constraint to. It's far from from far from point B, which means that there is a little bit of space where how much the constraint, the minimum amount that is required and how many interviews we ended up doing. So clearly there is some space here that this can move without really affecting the solution, which means that there are. It is expected to see some extra interviews than the minimum required. If you look at the other constraint, however, which is the blue line here, constraint constraint three, the constraint goes right through the optimal point. And this kind of constraint, we say this is a binding constraint. It is. It goes through the optimal solution. So maybe that constraint is right on the edge of the minimum requirement. And that's the constraint that's driving the numbers now to calculate how many extra interviews in both directions we are doing for personal interviews and phone interviews. We can take the constraints. We can take the let's take the first constraint and not the first, the second constraint. And and what we have at point B. At Point B, we have X one is equal to twenty seven point five, which is the optimal number here, and X two is equal to twenty. [00:34:08:11] Now the constraint if you plug this into the the constraint that we have is eighty. If you go back here. The constraint the second constraint is ATX one must be greater than or equal to a thousand. So if I convert this to a standard format by including a slack variable that will that's like variable will hold the amount of extra interview. So basically, I will have eighty by twenty seven point five minus. We call this we were going to call this as two as a slack variable for constraint to. As equal to 1000, and this means that as to is equal to 1200 extra. Phone interviews. Ok, in terms of. In terms of the. Personal interviews, terms of the personal interviews, if I take 40 by 20. Which is the value for X to minus three. Another Slack variable that represents the personal interviews equal to 800. It means that S3 in this case is equal to zero, so there is really no extra interviews for that for that variable. No extra. Personal interviews. Now, let's look back at the last requirement, and in the last requirement, we are asked what would be the effect on the optimal solution if the requirement for the personal interviews increased from 800 to 1200. So initially we said we have to have at least 800 interviews, personal interviews. Now what if I increase this? I bump this up to 12 100. So if that's the case, if that's the case, if we look back at. [00:36:46:22] Our solution here, if we look back at our solution here. What this translates to is this is the constraint that requires the 800 interviews now, which is the third country. If I increase that requirement, this constraint will go up by a certain amount. It will slide up by a certain amount. And to no this amount, I will need to calculate. So let's take part, see. If to calculate that, to calculate that amount, I can just simply say for 4x2, is it used to be 800 now what they are saying, increase this if this is increased. To 100, it means that 4x to greater than or equal to 100, and this means that extra would be equal to 200 divided by 40, which is equal to 30 when X two is equal to 30. It means that I can just substitute and get the body for x one. It will end up being. Twenty two point five. And for that, there would be three, two to five if I go back to. If I go back to my graph here, what this will do, it will shift this constraint all the way to X to equal to 30. So I will get a new optimal solution. I will get a new optimal solution. So if I take this figure, in fact, and. Included here. I can have now the new optimal solution, which will be right there. And the new point is no longer. [00:39:05:18] So no longer optimal solution here. So he is out of the picture and the new point, this will be the new. Optimal. So let's call it be prime, where be prime? So let's refer to this as be prime is equal, which is the new optimal. I have X one equals to two point five x two equals to thirty and Z equals to three two to five. What is worth mentioning here that although the optimal solution has changed because of this change, the the mix has not changed. So although I shifted the constraint, the mix has not changed. I still have a certain number of personal interviews, certain number of phone interviews. So the the the the the optimal solution definitely changed. But the mix the new solution did not really did not really change. So maybe we can mention this. So the new solution? Is now. The prime, but the optimal mix. Did not. Change, in other words, it's not that all of a sudden I shifted from one product to another. All of a sudden I shifted to all personal interviews or all person or phone interviews in this. In this particular example, this is not going to happen because it's a requirement to have a certain number of personal interviews and and phone interviews. But as we change these constraints, as we shift these constraints, it may eventually change the optimal mix in problems in general. In this case, it didn't really change the mix. However, it change the optimal solution.",6188,"[ 0.01301222 -0.0010215   0.02228367 ... -0.00529606 -0.02265909

Linear Programming Applications - Election Survey 2,3.4,CSLP,"Title: Linear Programming Applications - Election Survey 2; Description: Linear Programming Applications - Election Survey 2; Transcript: [00:00:01:14] Let's take a look at this problem again, the the election survey, where we have a firm that needs to be conducting surveys via phone or in person. And if they need to to hire a certain number of interviewers to conduct the survey, an interviewer can do 80 phone calls or 84 interviews per day, while an interviewer can do only 40 personal interviews in a single day. And we must meet the following criteria or constraints. First, at least you have to they the company has to do 3000 interviews, 1000 of them must be by phone, and at least 800 of them must be. Personal interviews and the cost of an interview is 50 dollars per day for a telephone interviewer and seventy dollars per day for a personal interviewer. And we want to know the minimum number of interviewers to hire. So to formulate a linear program and solving solving it in Excel. You probably have seen this when we discussed the graphical method where we define our decision variables as X one B being their phone and number of phone interviewers and X to number of personal interviewers. This is my objective function to minimize if the X OnePlus 7T X two, because that's the cost of an interviewer per day to conduct phone interviews, and this is the cost of an interviewer doing personal interviews. These are the three constraints that I just mentioned. Now to implement this and excel. To implement this in Excel. I have this spreadsheet. [00:01:56:04] Well, here is my decision variable just to blank cells. And this is the cost of per day represent here the yellow cells. They represent the number of interviewers by phone or personal. This is the cost for each type. And down here are the constraints. The objective function is to minimize the cost of the number of interviewers by the coefficients. So this is the sum product of the number of interviewers by the coefficients. And down here I have the constraints, the three constraints. These are the coefficients in the constraints. So the reason you see a zero here, because our constraint has only a term that uses x one, which is 80 x one, must be greater than or equal to 1000. And the third constraint has only a term that includes X2. So X1 is zero, where the first constraint has both X1 and X2. This equation is the sum product of the number of interviewers the X1 and X2 multiplied by the coefficients. So this is how we have the constraints set up. And this is just a label that shows you what the constraint if it's greater than or less than these are the requirements, the right hand side and what you see here is the surplus is the difference between how much you actually end up using or high or using out of your resources or they they. The number of interviews that we'll be conducting and how much is required. And at this point, because I have zero zero interviews, you see all of these negative surpluses. [00:03:35:13] And so that's my model. I want to minimize that cost function. Here and this is my decision variable, the number of telephone interviews and personal interviews and my constraints are all that must be the left hand side must be greater than or equal to the right hand side, which is the requirement. And that's it, also, I can make this I check this to make all variables one negative meaning X1 and X2 greater than or equal to zero. I don't have a requirement on having integer constraints or any of that, so I leave this as as it is. When you had solve that gives you the optimal solution. So I have now sort of found the optimal solution. I want to also generate a sensitivity report, so you click on that and you hit OK and it will generate the sensitivity report. I already generated the report, so I'm going to use the one that I generated earlier. So that's my optimal solution to seven seven five. This is the optimal number of interviewers for X one, and this is the number. Interviewers for four interviewers and four personnel is 20 x two is twenty, and you can compare that to the graphical solution that we obtained in the past and see your results. The second. So I also generate sensitivity report, and I have questions about that in the slides here. So I formulated the program, I found the solution using Excel. [00:05:11:04] Now, if the firm could reduce the minimum interview requirement for either one of the either the phone interviews or the personal interviews, which one would you select and how much would a reduction of one interview in the requirement would reduce the total cost and solve this look? Do this by looking at the sensitivity report and verify this by doing it by by by resolving the model, not just by looking at the sensitivity report. So let's look at this requirement. And excel, you can pose at this point and think about or go to excel and think about how you're going to see which one you're going to select and then compare it to my answer. So they in the sensitivity report that we generated, it gives us here the optimal values. It also gives us the coefficients and it will give us it gives us the sensitivity range on the coefficients in the objective function. And if you recall this from the graphical method, we manually determined these changes. So if you recall the graphical method, we determined that the range can go from zero to 140 and this is exactly what this computer output is giving us because the objective function is given here 50 x one plus 70 x two, so that a sensitivity analysis on the coefficient for x one is what I just showed you, so it can go down all the way to zero. [00:06:49:21] So that's the allowable decrease to go down to zero or to increase by 90 or to go up to 140. So that's what the computer is giving us for the second coefficient. For the second coefficient, where I have 70 X2, it can go down to, it's allowed to decrease by by 45, so it can go down to 25. And it's allowed to increase to infinity. So this is how you determine the range on the coefficient. Anyway, that was not the requirement for Part B. In Part B, we were asked that if you are to change that requirement, if you are to change in the model, the requirement they own, the personal interview on the phone interviews and in the personal interview. Which one would you change? Which one would you relax if it has to be a if you can reduce this requirement instead of a thousand, you relax it to maybe 799 or to 799 or to 999. Which one would you choose? So the most the logical thing to do is just go to the model and make these changes and rerun. But the analysis can also give us insight into this. So if you look at the shadow prices, the shadow prices give us the value of the resources. And although in this case we don't have resources, we have minimum requirements. So in maximization and minimization problems and whenever we have. We have minimum requirements. The shadow price, meaning what is the best if you get to relax some of these requirements, which one would give you the best result in terms of objective function and where we need to look is at the second and third constraint to know which which one would you reduce. [00:08:46:28] And from this one, you can see that the the the enhancement or the improvement, the reduction in cost for the telephone interviews will not be affected by making it making this reducing this requirement for four interviews. In other words, if I go back to my model and I make this a little bit more relaxed for phone interviews, so it must be, let's say, greater than or equal to 900 instead of 1000 or 999. Just one interview compared to 799. The 799 would give me better reduction in the objective function, better improvement in this case, since I have a cost that would be a reduction in cost. So what this tells me, if I relax the right hand side constraint that I have here from 800 to 799, I will be saving on a dollar and 125 on each interview that I relax, and that's within the range of 800 to 200. That's only valid between 800 between zero to 12. So basically to up to 100, that's valid. So in other words, if I'm to choose between phone interviews, requirement relaxation or reduction compared to personal interviews, I should go with the personal interviews. And if you also notice not only based on the shadow price, if you also notice here that the constraint range is that I can increase the. [00:10:27:29] As for the phone interviews I can, I'm allowed to increase it up to 200 and decrease it to infinity, which is basically I cannot really decrease it to infinity, but it will be to zero. So it ranges between zero and 100, while here the range, the valid range is 800 to 100. So make sure that you understand that the shadow prices are valid only over these ranges that are given to me and outside of these ranges, I don't know. So that was the first, the first requirement. And suppose that I want to relax this by one one interview, whether it's personal or whether it's personal or phone interviews, if I relax it by one interview. What this tells me that I will not save anything on the cost. It will be zero saving on the cost. While if I reduce this by one interview, this should save me a dollar and 125. So let's verify this using the computer to make sure that we understand the meaning of this shadow price. So if I go back here. I go back to my model and I relaxed this requirement, so at this point I have 800, so if I make this 799, OK, keep in mind that the cost so far is 27 75. So if I'm just if I write this here two seven seven five so that I don't forget what the original value is. [00:12:01:18] So this is the original original cost. And if I relax this constraint to 799. And I solve again. It found a solution, and I said, OK. Notice how the cost drop to this figure if I take the difference between. So the new value is the new value is this one. I'm going to just copy and paste the value here. Okay. And the difference the difference is between the original minus, the new value is one 25, which is really exactly the same as the shadow price value. If I reduce it by 10 of them, then you just multiply the shadow prices by 10, making sure that I have within the range and 10 is within the range. So if you can relax this by 10 ads or by by 10 phone calls or by 10 personal interviews, which one would you choose? I would choose the personal interviews and I make sure that I'm within the same range. And then if I am within the same range, I can multiply that 10 by the this shadow price, and that will give me the saving in the cost. Now. Let's take a look at the final requirement, and it says identify the sensitivity ranges for the cost of a personal interview and the number of total interviews. So the cost of a personal interview, if I go back to my sensitivity range, this is the personal interviews cost. That's the coefficient. So I think I already discussed this that I can allow this. [00:13:48:05] If this cost drops to 45 by 45, it drops to 25. You are not going to change the optimal solution. You're not going to change the switch, the optimal solution from one point to another yet so it will remain the optimal optimal solution. Now the z value would be different, of course, but the optimal solution would remain the same and I can increase it to infinity. Now, the number of total interviews is right here because it's a constraint that he's asking about and I can increase. I can reduce the total number by 100 so I can have on the right hand side of this constraint. 3000 minus 100 over here on first constraint. And that's the allowable decrease and the allowable increases to infinity. So I there is no. There is no bound on the how much I can increase the total, the total interviews. Requirement. So that's how I solve this problem using Excel and how I generated the sensitivity report from which I can make get some insights into the value of the resources or the minimum requirements, their value and also the sensitivity analysis on the the coefficients on the objective function that just gives me the range, as well as the allowable increase and decrease on the constraint side on the right hand side of the constraint that range before the solutions, which is we switch the mix of the optimal solution.",2726,"[ 0.00504791 -0.00583359  0.01770984 ... -0.00654846 -0.01748054

Such applications are very common in practice. In this example, we have a manufacturing company that produces T-shirts and sweatshirts. It produces two types of each, depending on whether there is a print in the front or on the front and back. The production is limited to 72 hours, so we need to run a batch of T-shirts and sweatshirts. But we are limited to three days of 24 hours a day and shipping is done by trucks and the truck capacity is limited to 100 standard sized boxes. A standard box holds 12 T-shirts. Sweatshirts take more space and one dozen of sweatshirt box sweatshirts in a box is three times the size of a standard box. So, if I have a standard box where I can fit 12 T-shirts, I need to fit one dozen or 12 sweatshirts. I need three of these boxes, so they occupy three times the space of the T-shirts. I have a limited amount of budget of $25,000, and I have available to me 500 dozen blank T-shirts and sweatshirts in stock. The question I'm trying to answer here is how many dozens? And a dozen each can fit into one box of each type of share to produce. So, if I have if I produce a dozen T-shirts, it will be equivalent to a box. If I produce one dozen sweatshirts, it's equivalent to three boxes of T-shirts or standard boxes. [00:01:50:21] To start with, I will first go over my data. So, the data that is necessary for the model is the processing time, the cost, and the profit. So, for each sweatshirt with the front print, I need 0.1 hour to produce a dozen or to print basically on the front of a dozen sweatshirts. I need 0.1 hour which is 10 percent of an hour, that's equivalent to six minutes for each dozen. It costs me $36 and the profit per dozen is $90. So, the labor cost is pretty much embedded in the data. It's not explicitly given to us. The sweatshirts if I do back and front, it will take me a 0.25 of an hour, a quarter of an hour. And then it will cost me $48 and the profit is $125. The T-shirts, they, they need that much of time, cost, and profit. And if I do back and front, it will take longer. It will cost more, but the profit is more. The underlying assumption here is that the amounts that I'm going to produce, they are all required. There is an order and I know that I will be paid for the production. So, this is my data. Let's define first our decision variables. If I define my decision variables as x1, the number of sweatshirts front printing only, x2 is the number of sweatshirts back and front printing. x3 is the number of T-shirts for front printing, and x4 is the number of T-shirts back and front. I have the data already for each one of these types. My objective will naturally be to maximize my profit. If you go back to this table, the profit for type one is $90 for type two, $125, and so on. So, if I produce x1 as the sweatshirts, I will make $90 multiplied by the number I produce plus $125. The profit for the front and back, front and back sweatshirts $125. And for the front only T-shirts is $45 and front and back is $65, multiplied by the number of front and back T-shirts. That will give me the total amount of profit, and I'm trying to determine the values for these decision variables x1 x2 x3 x4 so that I maximize my profit. If I didn't have these constraints, I can sell an infinite amount of T-shirts and sweatshirts and that will maximize my profit. But that's not realistic. Usually, in reality, I have constraints, resource constraints and processing constraints. We typically say maximize a certain objective subject to. Whenever you see the term subject to it means I have a set of constraints, even if I don't explicitly say that these are the constraints whenever I say subject to it means that these are my constraints. The first one is the amount of time required. So, if I produce the sweatshirts front and back, it takes me 0.1 hours. So, if I produce x1 of them, I will multiply 0.1 by the number plus 0.25 by the number of sweatshirts front and back. This one was for just front. x2 is for front and back sweatshirts, x3 and x4 for the t shirts, front only and front and back, respectively. So, I have the total amount here for of time necessary for all four types of shirts. The total amount must be less than or equal to 72 hours. Just make sure that the units are consistent. So, if I'm using hours, then I will have to use the coefficient that they represent hours. If I give you these in minutes and these in hours, you need to convert from one to the other. The second constraint is if you go back to the description of the problem, we are restricted to the truck capacity of 1,200 standard sized boxes. Keep in mind that a standard box will hold one T-shirt, but you need three times the space or three boxes, basically for a dozen sweatshirts. So, this is reflected in this constraint the number of boxes, standard boxes for the T-shirts as x3 and x4. [00:06:39:08] So I add up these boxes plus three times the standard box. So when I defined my x1, here is the number of sweatshirts as if they are, they fit in a standard box. So, for sweatshirts, whenever I produce and am ready to ship sweatshirts, they need three times the space or three times a standard box. So, this is why I will multiply by 3x1+ 3x2. Now, x3 and x4 are for T-shirts and a dozen will fit in one box, so since I'm defining that a box will hold a dozen T-shirts, then I don't need to multiply by anything. It is 12 T-shirts is equivalent to a box, but here 12 sweatshirts is equivalent to three boxes. This is why I multiply by three. So, when I define the number of dozens here for sweatshirts or for for T-shirts implicitly saying that a dozen of a standard box holds a dozen T-shirts, but I need three times three times that box to fit a dozen sweatshirts. So, the space is another limitation. It must be less than or equal to 1200. As far as the budget, the cost, over here, of producing sweatshirts. $36 per dozen, $38 for the back and front sweatshirts, $25 and $35 for the T-shirts, I have here multiplied by the number of dozens of sweatshirts front only and back and front. [00:08:18:05] The cost for T-shirts must be less than or equal to my maximum budget of $25,000. And finally, I have five dozen sweatshirts blank available to me to print on them, whether they are front and back or just front. The total amount of sweatshirts must be less than or equal to 500, the total amount or the total dozens, how many dozens sweatshirts also must be less than or equal to 500. Dozens of T-shirts, so I cannot exceed that number. These are my raw materials. And finally, the last constraint is the non-negativity constraint, where I say that all my decision variables must be zero or positive. They cannot be negative. Now this is my mathematical formulation. Specifically, this is the linear programming mathematical formulation, and that's the complete model given the data that we are given. If we were, let's say, provided with labor cost and then we have a limit on the number of people working for us and how many hours then I need that constraint for labor. If I have due dates, then I will have a constraint for due dates, and so on. This is the data that we have in this scenario and this is our mathematical model. Let's now see how we can do this in Excel. This is the solution, the final solution. But I will show you how to do this in excel. this is the model, just a picture of the model that you see down here. [00:09:54:09] The same thing that I have on that slide. These are my x1 through x4. The yellow cells represent the decision variables, the optimal values for x1, x2, x3, x4. And initially, I start with nothing. I don't know what, how much I'm going to produce. So if you start with 0, 0, 0, the profit will be 0. This is the profit per box of x1 of the first type, this is the profit for per box or per dozen of the sweatshirt front and back, and these are for the T-shirts. This is the processing time for each type. This is the shipping capacity, which tells us in the second constraint here that a box of a dozen sweatshirts is three times as large a regular dozen T-shirts. So, this is why I multiply by three and the total space cannot exceed 200 in the truck. You don't really care what you have inside the boxes other than the space that they occupy. This is why we were able to say 3x1 the number of dozens because they occupy three times as much in terms of space. And this is the budget coefficients. And finally, because I have this constraint of x1 + x2 and x3 + x4, and because I would like to use the function that some product function, I put the coefficients of 1 and 1 for x3 and x4 for x1 and x12, also 1 and 1. [00:11:34:19] These are the coefficients of the x1. They these are my decision variables, and the profit equation is the sum product of the profit per box that you see highlighted here multiplied by how many dozens I'm going to produce. So, this is the profit per dozen for each type. And this is how many dozens I must produce to maximize my profit. If the total amount, if I produce one of each one. If I produce, let's say, 1, 1, 1, 1, it will take the 90(1) + 125(1) + 45(1) + 65(1). That will give me a profit of 325. The question is, what is the optimal value for these decision variables so that I have the maximum value in this green cell and the right-hand side? This represents the righthand side of the constraints that you see down here. So, in this case, which represents really the usage of time, the usage of space, the usage of money, the usage of blank Tshirts or sweatshirts. So, for instance, if I take this first one is the sum product of the processing time for each one by how many I am going to produce. So, it will multiply the 0.1 by the number here, plus 0.25 by the number here, plus, and so on for all of them. [00:12:56:13] And that's for in this case, if I produce one dozen of each, it will use only 0.6 hours. I have available 72. So, if I produce two of each, note how my profit will change, and I’m still way below my hours. Ok, if we take the capacity, let's say, or the capacity, I will have sum product of the coefficients multiplied by the decision variables that gives me this value over here. The same formula applies for all of them. So, in reality, while you are developing this, you develop the formula for one cell only and then you can drag the cell down all the way. Especially if you fix the decision variables, we're using the dollar sign in Excel. Notice how I use the dollar sign in Excel over here. If you notice here the dollar sign in the formula. It means that you need you fix this range and you apply the same formula all the way down to all constraints. So, this is how I can do it quickly, especially if you have a large number of constraints. Again, the budget is the coefficients, the cost per dozen multiplied by the number of dozens down here. It will give me the cost. I'm still way below cost and these are the last two constraints. Note here that I still use the same product, including the blank cells. And in Excel by default, it will give these blank cells 0 values because they are blank. [00:14:28:18] This is equivalent to saying I have 0 and 0 coefficients here and 0 and 0 coefficients here. So these are just symbols, they are just for you, for good readability of the model. And this is what's available, the right-hand side, which is also a given number, it's not a formula. It's a given number to us. The leftover number is the difference between what is available and how much I used. So, if I used only 1.3 hours, I am left with 70.7 hours to process T-shirts and sweatshirts. So, this represents the slack in my variables. How much is left over? Now, I put here arbitrarily, I pick 2 2 2 2, but we ideally we would like to know the optimal values for these decision variables and to know that I go to my Solver under the Data tab. Here's the data. Here's my solver. And in the objective function, I will select the green cell to be my objective, make sure I select Maximize and these are my changing cells. They represent my decision variables down here and my constraints. Although you see only one value, it's really one line. It really represents all five constraints. So, if you look at this, what we are saying that this range must be less than or equal to this range. So, these are including constraints on all of these five cells, not only on one cell, although I have only one line. That's the nice thing about using the same sign in the constraints. [00:16:14:25] This way, I can select the whole range and make it less than or equal to the right-hand side range. But sometimes it may not be it may not be possible, especially if it makes more sense to have a greater than or equal to sign, or sometimes you have equal to sign. So, you cannot really select the range this way all the time. But if you if you have the same sign, go ahead and select the whole range on the left-hand side and make it less than or equal to the whole range on the right-hand side, if you select this option, make unconstrained the variables non-negative it will implement this last constraint that you see down here x1, x2, x3, x4 greater than or equal to 0. This is a linear model, so we make sure that we have the Simplex Linear programming and when we hit Solve. We have to make to pay attention to the message that we get solved, Solver find a solution, all constraint and optimality conditions are satisfied, and I like this. It means that it's an optimal solution and when I hit, you have the option of keeping the Solver solution or restore the original values that I started with. [00:17:25:29] So I'm going to keep the Solver solution to see my solution. And in this case, what the solution is to produce 175.5, 57.77, 500 and 0 of x4.. So, to maximize profit, you produce none of the T-shirts that have front and back because they are time consuming. They're costly and they don't produce as much profit, so optimally these are my values that will maximize the profit, and that will be my profit values. So, in this scenario, that would be my optimal solution. In some cases, it could be I may have a constraint enforced by my customers that says at least you have to produce certain amount of x4 or the front and back T-shirts. In this case, I will have to add an additional scenario, an additional constraint, I mean, that enforces the production of front and back T-shirts. So, suppose that, as an example, suppose that the client says you can't just produce 0 front and back. You have to have some front and back. And let's say we limit them to, let's say, 50. So in Solver, I would go and say this decision variable. I would add another decision, another constraint that enforces this decision variable, which is the number of front and back T-shirt to be greater than or equal to 50. Or you can add it in the Excel spreadsheet as an additional line with coefficients of 0 0 0 for x1 x2 x3 and put a constraint of 1 on x4 and the right-hand side over here will be 50. [00:19:16:22] So the 50 will be here and here. You will have some product in this cell sum product formula. Now, if I had solve, what do I expect to see that profit? Do you think it will go up or down? You can pause for a second and think about it before you see the outcome. But the way you should be thinking is that when I let the model free from this constraint of a minimum amount, it said the best I can provide, the best profit I can provide I can get is this number right here. By adding more constraints, what do you expect? Do you think things will get better or worse by adding constraints? Let's see what's going to happen. You can pause, think about it, do your prediction and see it compared to the outcome. So, let's solve it with this scenario. Solver found an optimal solution, note how the profit went down because I have this constraint of 50, so the model really doesn't want to produce anything for x4 because it's not that profitable compared to the other ones. It wants to produce as much as possible from x3 and the left from x1 and x2. But because I enforce that constraint of 50 now, it took 50 out of the x3, which is the only front T-shirts and it produced the 50 minimum limit on the front and back T-shirts. Scenarios like this are very useful because in reality, I may have a little bit of uncertainty or I may have additional constraints that may happen. So, for instance, although I know that the profit is $90, but what if the profit is a little bit lower? How does that impact my solution? What is it? A little bit higher? You can do some sensitivity analysis with this with this kind of model, but that tells you if I go back to the model without this constraint, if I delete this constraint and hit Solve again, I go back to my optimal solution where it doesn't produce any of the front and back T-shirts, but it produces the maximum front T-shirts because they are the most profitable. They get done quickly. They don't cost as much. They don't take much space, and so on. So, I produce 500. As far as the sweatshirts, notice how you have a fractional value and in linear programming this is one of the requirements that you say you have to accept fractional values for linear programming to work. If we don't want to have any fractional values, then we will be using integer programming where we put a constraint on these decision variables and we say these must be integers. [00:22:18:09] And it is not necessarily the same optimal solution. If you round these numbers, you may not end up with the same optimal solution. In other words, if I round this up instead of 175 to 176, first of all, I will be violating my constraints so I cannot really round up given my resources, so I will have to round down. When I round down and also this number now, maybe if I round it up, I may still get a feasible solution given I rounded this one down. But it may not. If it doesn't, then to make sure I will get a feasible solution. I will also have to round this down. Rounding this down will give you a reasonable solution. So, if I do 57 here and I do 175 here, I'm not far off my profit. But what linear programming tells you -- these numbers with their fractional values, they are the absolute optimal values and what to do with these values, whether it makes sense to produce exactly the same number. Clearly, you cannot produce half shirts or three quarters of a sweatshirt. But that's your reference point. This is the optimal. If you want to make sure that you have an optimal integer solution, then the problem turns into an integer program that will be discussed in a different module. Over here, approximating may not lead necessarily to the optimal solution if you want absolutely an integer solution. [00:23:56:27] However, rounding up and down when you have numbers or problems of this of this nature, it may violate the feasibility. So, to make sure you always round in one way. In this case, we will have to round down and rounding down may not necessarily always end up with the with the optimal solution. An integer optimal solution may end up being a different solution with a higher number than this one. But for this topic, that's my optimal solution, and from there, in reality, I can either say, OK, I have a fraction here, I cannot produce a fraction, so you can round one of them down and round the other one up to see if you end up with a feasible solution without violating your constraints or to be on the safe side, you can just round both of them down and live with the difference from the optimal solution. This type of problem is called the product mix problem. And as you can imagine, there are many real-life applications for it to know how many to produce of each type of product whenever a company produces multiple types, or whenever a company produces or provides different services, different service types and you want to know what is the best mix of products or services that will maximize or optimize your objective. You may have a cost minimization or you have a profit maximization. Basically, you want to optimize your objective function.",4974,"[ 0.01513148  0.01434422 -0.00917363 ... -0.00284382 -0.00682852

In this problem we need to design a breakfast for a group of people. This is a common application in schools and prisons, in nursing homes, and so on, where you have to meet certain dietary requirements and your objective is to minimize the cost. So, if we want to design a breakfast where we have at least 420 calories and at least 5 mg of iron, at least 400 mg of calcium, 20 g of protein, 12 g of fiber, and a maximum 20 g of fat -- we don't want to exceed that and we don't want to exceed 30 mg of cholesterol. And our objective is to meet all of these requirements and minimize the cost at the same time. And the data given to us, we can select from these 10 items. Obviously, you can have more items, but the same approach will apply. And we are giving the calories, the fat grams, the cholesterol, iron, calcium, protein, fiber. And the cost of a cup of cereal, let's say, and a cup of dry cereal, a cup of oatmeal, and so on. So this is the cost per unit, the units don't have to be the same. So, for instance, we may have a cup of an item and we may have a slice of another item or as you can see here, a slice of bread, and so on. [00:01:40:06] So if I select a cup of cereal that has 90 calories, 0 fat, 9 cholesterol, six mg of iron, and so on, and it costs us 18 cents to include a cup of cereal bran cereal. So, as you can see, you have a lot of possibilities. And the question is which items should I select and in which amounts so that I meet the dietary requirements and at the same time, minimize the total cost for the breakfast to develop the model? Let's start first by defining our decision variables. If I define x1 to be the cups of bran cereal and x2 is the cups of dry cereal, and so on for all the different items. These are my decision variables, and I would like to determine the optimal amounts of these items subject to the constraints that are given to me. The mathematical model is to minimize the cost and the cost is the cost per unit, which is in the case of the brand cereal. It's 18 cents multiplied by how many cups of cereal I have, plus 22 cents by how many cups of dry cereal I have, or a fraction of a cup. It can be half cup, three quarters of a cup, and so on, and the same for all of them. So, you take that column of cost, multiply that by the decision variables representing the cups of cereal, the cups of oatmeal, and so on. [00:03:13:24] The number of eggs and so on. That's my objective function. And these are my constraints. The first constraint is to exceed 420 calories. So, the amount of calories per cup multiplied by the number of cups that will give me 90(x1) plus 110 per cup of dry cereal multiplied by the number of cups, and so on for all, the items must be greater than or equal to 420. The fat must be less than 20 g. So, if you go back to your data, and look at the fat column over here. As you can see for dry cereal, it has two g of rice, two g of fat, two g of fat for the oatmeal and so on. So, for the fat constraint, the multiplication or the sum product of the fat per unit multiplied by the number of units must be the total must be less than or equal to 20 g of fat. The cholesterol, the same concept 270, by the number of units. So, if I go back to my data and look at cholesterol notice that everything else is 0 except for the eggs, the bacon, and milk. So, I don't really have to include the other ones because they're going to be multiplied by 0. And they aren't the same idea, the number of milligrams of iron multiplied by the amounts, by the decision variables must be greater than or equal to five. [00:04:52:07] Same concept for the calcium. Same concept for the protein and for the fiber. So, notice here that sometimes I have to exceed a certain minimum level of fiber or protein or calcium. Some other times I have to stick to a maximum of a certain amount, so I have to have less than or equal to. You can have a 0 fat or five g of fat or whatever the amount is, but you cannot exceed 20 g of fat and 30 mg of cholesterol. And finally, all decision variables must be not negative, they can be 0 or above. Now to implement this in Excel. This is a snapshot of the final solution. Let's see how we get to that solution. If I look at the spreadsheet for this example, let's suppose that I start...I don't know what my decision variables are, so I'm going to start with 0 for everything. Okay. Everything here is 0. These are my decision variables for the different types of items, and this is the unit. This is just for readability. It doesn't really affect anything. As long as within each constraint I'm consistent with the units. There is no issue. This is the cost that's given to me. All of this is data given to me. This is the dietary content. So, for the bran cereal, I have 90 calories per cup, 110 for the dry cereal, and so on, and the same thing for the fat, cholesterol, iron, calcium, protein, and fiber. [00:06:34:29] All of this data is given to me. These are my decision variables. My objective is to minimize the total cost, so if I multiply the number of units multiplied by the cost per unit in the blue area here, that will give me my objective function value. So, if I, just for the sake of the argument, if I have one cup, one unit, one unit for all of them, as you can see, the cost will be $1.94. But that's not a good solution because I violate some of the constraints. Let's take a look at the constraints. The nutritional level, which is basically the sum product of the amount of calories multiplied by the amount of each item, so 90 multiplied by the number of cups, 110 multiplied by the number of dry cereal cups, and so on. That will give me the total amount of calories, and this amount must be greater than or equal to 420. These signs are just for readability. They’re not included in the model. This is my left-hand side of the constraint and this is my right-hand side of the constraint. This is the fat constraint where I multiply the fat per unit multiplied by the number of units must be less than or equal to 20. This, even when I have one unit for each item, I'm still within that constraint. [00:08:10:22] The cholesterol is the same idea. Sum product of the amounts of cholesterol per unit multiplied by the number of units. And again, I use here the sum product formula, and I fixed the decision variable cells by including the dollar sign over here. And that allows me to input the formula only once, so I can input the formula only once here and drag it for the rest of the cells. Just if you would like to see how this is actually done in Excel. If I didn't have these cells, let's say, actually none of these cells are blank and I develop only one constraint. And I fixed the range of decision variables by including these dollar signs here. When I drag this over, look how the cursor becomes like a dark, small plus, I drag it over. It will carry over the formula to all of the columns, but it will move over each column, but will keep this column of decision variables fixed. If I look at the left-hand side of the cholesterol, it must be less than 30. Now I have 290. So clearly this solution is not feasible because I'm supposed to not exceed 30 mg of cholesterol. But this solution of selecting one unit for each item gave me 290 mg. The same thing for the rest of the constraints so that one cup of each or one unit of each item is infeasible. [00:09:51:08] You can start with that solution and let Solver decide for you. I like to start with everything with 0. And what I want to do is to minimize my objective function subject to meeting these constraints. This snapshot is simply the model written out so that you don't have to go back and forth between the slide and the Excel spreadsheet. You can just look at the constraints here. If I go to my data solver and I pick the green cell to be my objective function, keep in mind that I'm minimizing here. So, minimizing by changing the decision variables. So, the yellow area here is the decision variables. Note that I have a bunch of constraints here, and the reason I have more than one is because in Solver, you could have selected this whole range and you say this is less than or equal to this whole range, except that in this case, we have sometimes greater than or equal to, sometimes less than or equal to. And for the for this reason, you have to select each constraint individually, or you could include two cells because these are less than/less than you can say these two cells are less than or equal to two these two cells. But I included each cell separately in a separate constraint. So, for instance, if I take the first one, it's it says that this cell that you see active over here must be greater than or equal to 420 or the right-hand side of the constraint. [00:11:36:09] The same thing for the rest of the constraints. This cell must be less than or equal to the right-hand side of the country. It's really important to be careful which side you select here, because if you select the wrong one, it will give you some times an infeasible solution or unbounded problem, or it may give you a solution that's not valid. It may be a feasible solution, but it's not necessarily an optimal solution. If you select make unconstrained variables not negative, that will ensure that all of the decision variables are either zero or positive numbers, and the Solver I want to pick is the Simplex Linear programming and the Simplex Linear programming guarantees that this problem is linear and it will solve it as a linear program. If you select something else, it will treat it as a non-linear program unnecessarily. Under options, you keep everything as is. However, if you select this option, ignore integer constraints. I don't have really any integer constraints, so even if I unselect this, it doesn't really affect anything. But just in case this was selected because I don't have a constraint to enforce the integer conditions on any of the decision variables at this point. So, if I solve, Solver gave me all constraints and optimality conditions satisfied, I will say OK to keep these values, and that gives me the optimal solution that you see on the slide, which is 50 cents or almost 51 cents for this meal. [00:13:18:02] And that will be my optimal solution. Minimum cost meets all of the conditions. Let's take a look at the solution. So, basically what we're saying have a cup or almost a cup, a cup and a fraction of oatmeal and have a cup and a quarter of milk and about three slices of wheat toast. A couple of things here to consider this breakfast may not be very realistic. Typically, you would want two pieces of toast to make a sandwich, for instance. You can have three, of course, but someone may say, well, you know, I want really just to have two slices of bread. That's a more practical and realistic breakfast instead of putting three slices of bread. If this is a requirement where someone wants just to include two slices of bread, then I need another constraint that enforces this condition. Let's try to do it on the fly, so if I go to Solver here and I say add a constraint and I will pick the number of slices of bread, and I will say I want this to be exactly equal to two. You can have these two in the spreadsheet and select the cell that has that number. But just to do it quickly, I just type in “2” here and then I can hit solve again. [00:14:52:05] Keep in mind that adding more constraints will never improve the model, it may produce the same result, but it will not improve it. It may be worse, but not better. If I hit solve and I get now another optimal solution, the cost of this breakfast has increased a little bit to almost 54 cents. And although you are limited your bread to two slices, but you had to compensate for the nutritional level that you lost in the third slice of bread to something else; you have now more milk. You have now more oat to include an oatmeal and oat bran to include so that you meet the nutritional requirements. So, this is a little more realistic. You may say, well, it's it. It is not practical to measure the milk by 1.33 cup. I would like to have either one cup or an integer value. So, let's say I want to have exactly one cup or a maximum of one cup. You can enforce the constraint in the same way. The other aspect to this problem is that a breakfast may end up not very tasty in, although it meets the requirements, and it minimizes the cost. It is not necessarily the best breakfast, so you may want to include some other items and you want to enforce them. So, if that's the case, then you can say I need to include maybe some eggs, or bacon, or orange juice in it. [00:16:29:18] And to do this, you will include another constraint. So, let's suppose that we want to have at least half cup of orange juice. You can just say you can just add another constraint and say this cell, which is the orange juice, is greater than or equal to 0.5 cup. And so, I have to have at least half a cup of orange juice and then I will solve again, and now I have another solution that enforces the 0.5 cups. Again, the cost went up to 70 cents, almost 71 cents, because I enforce this additional constraint and so on. So, you can design a breakfast that's tasty and meets the nutritional requirements. And at the same time, you minimize the cost that will meet these conditions. You can run different scenarios. This is a famous and well-known problem in the linear programming field. And sometimes it may get a little more complicated with the type of constraints that you can include, but you get the idea, the point here is to show you how you can design a meal with the specific requirements on the nutrition. At the same time, you minimize the cost. And what you see on the slide is a snapshot of the optimal solution for the basic problem, without these additional constraints that we added. You can play around with it and design the breakfast that you like and see how much the optimal cost will be.",3519,"[ 0.01771815  0.00914942 -0.00165432 ...  0.00024857 -0.0161516

Linear Programming Modeling Applications - Investment System,4.3,LP-ME,"Title: Linear Programming Modeling Applications - Investment System; Description: Linear Programming Modeling Examples - Investment Application; Transcript: [00:00:00:26] Let's now take another linear programming application in this case, an investment application, suppose that we have $70000 to invest all of it in municipal bonds, CDs, Treasury bills and growth stock with return on investment as follows. So if I invest in municipal bonds, it will give me eight and a half percent CDs, five percent, Treasury bills, 6.5 percent and Growth Stock Fund 13 percent. And we would like to invest this 70000 all of it, so that we maximize the profit subject to the following constraints. Clearly, if I didn't have any constraints, I would invest everything in the highest return, which is the municipal bonds. But we have some limitations. These limitations are as follows. No more than 20 percent in municipal bonds. See, the investment must not exceed the other three types of investments, so you can't really invest everything in CDs cannot be the CDs must be less than or equal to the the summation of the other types of investment. At least 30 percent of investments should be in Treasury bills and CDs together, so 30 percent of the investment is in these two, and the ratio of CD and Treasury bills to municipal bonds and growth stock must be at least 1.2 to one. The issue? It must be 1.2. So let's see how we develop a linear program that will help us decide on our investments to define our decision variables first. [00:01:45:15] If I define each type to be x one x two extra X for so x one will be the amount of municipal bonds x two is the seed x three is the Treasury bills and X4 is the growth stock and I want to maximize the profit. So clearly the eighty eight point five percent eighty eight point five percent by the amount of investment in this type, plus the five percent by the amount of investment of the second type. The second type, if you go back here, it's the CDs and sixty five six point five percent by the Treasury bills and 13 percent buy the growth stock. And this is my objective is to maximize this objective function. The constraints are the first one. Let's go back and visit the constraints no more than 20 percent in municipal bonds. So municipal bonds are one defined as x one, so they must be less than or equal to 20 percent by 70000. That will give me 14000, so I cannot exceed 14000 of investment in this type of fund. The second one is the CDs not to exceed the rest of the three investments. So the CDs are the X two, so X two must be less than or equal the summation of the other three types. And if I move everything to the left hand side, I will have this form of an equation. And the reason I do this because we call this the standard format. [00:03:21:20] We want to put it in a standard format where all my decision variables are on the left hand side. So a standard format, I put all my decision variables on the left hand side. At the right hand side, I leave a constant can be zero or something else. If you want to just to make sure that you see how we got this. They let's try this out. The CDs X to. X2 must be. And less than or equal to the other three times X one plus x three plus x four. So when I move things around, then it will be minus x one plus x to minus x three minus x four must be. Less than or equal to zero? This is how we got this equation. And. The third constraint is that the let's go back to it, at least 30 percent of investments should be in Treasury bills and CDs, so Treasury bills and CDs are x two plus x three must be greater than or equal to 30 percent by 70000. One third of the 70000 will give you this amount 21000. So I must exceed invest 10000 or more in CDs and Treasury bills. The third one is a little bit or this one, the fourth one is a little bit more unusual. So let's go back to this constraint, where it says the ratio of CD and Treasury bills to municipal bonds and growth stock must be at least 1.2 to one. [00:05:11:02] So the CDs and Treasury bills are X two and X three, and the bonds and the growth stock are X1 and X4. Pause here for a second and try to see how you would model that, how you model the issue. Let me show you. What we've done here, the ratio between so that was one constraint. Another constraint is that the ratio between the CDs and. The other the other factor is. The ratio of CDs and Treasury bills, so Treasury bills is three. So X two plus x three. Issue A. To the other two types, X4 and one. Must be greater than or equal to one point two over one in linear programming, you don't want to divide decision variables by each other because that makes the problem nonlinear unnecessarily. There is a very easy way to make this linear equation, so we arranged we rearrange this such that we will have x two plus x three is greater than or equal to. 1.2 x one plus 1.2. For. Because I want to put it in a standard format, I will move all decision variables to the left hand side. So I will have minus 1.2 x one. Plus X two plus x three minus, if I move the last term one point two. [00:07:05:06] X for. Must be greater than or equal to zero, and this is how we got that constraint. That you see the slide. So going over here, you see this constraint must be greater than or equal to zero. And finally, I have to put a limit on the amount invested. So the total amount I invest in the four different types must be equal to 70000. So I need to invest all of it. I cannot save anything. And the final constraint is to have the non- negative constraint by saying each one of these investment must be either zero or above. You cannot have a negative investment. Let's see how we implement this in Excel so that we arrive to this optimal solution. An excel. Here are my decision variables that you see in the yellow cells. Initially, I start with zero, everything is zero, I don't know the answer. These are my coefficients where they represent the profit per unit of investment. And what you see here is the area that includes the coefficients for the constraints. So for instance, in the first constraint, I have a snapshot of the of the model right here. So in the in the first constraint X, one must be less than or equal to 14000. So I have a confession to only four x one. And the rest are zero, I left them blank. You can put zeros in here, it doesn't matter. [00:08:40:06] Excel will consider this as a zero. So x one by one. So the decision variable x won by the coefficient one. This is the constraint that reflect this that reflects this. This is the constraint that reflects this. Multiplication must be less than or equal to fourteen thousand. Notice here that for convenience, instead of selecting each cell, multiply it by the coefficient for convenience. I use the same product and the same product here will end up multiplying zero zero zero by the decision variables over here. So the decision variables, it doesn't affect the model, but it is very convenient and more readable to do it this way. So I highly encourage you to use this function. It makes your life easier, and it makes it very easy for people to review your work. The second constraint which you see over here, the negative constraints are four x one and the negative coefficients are for x one x three and X4, as you see down here. And the X2 has a positive coefficient so that some product of these coefficients by their decision variables will give me this left hand side of the constraint and it must be less than or equal to zero, as you see in the constraint down here. The third constraint is that Treasury bills and CDs must be greater than or equal to 30 percent. This is, by the way, 14 percent is 14000 is 20 percent and 21000 is the 30 percent of the the 70000. [00:10:14:19] So in this constraint, I have X2 and X3. They have positive coefficients and the other two are zeros. But I still can use the same product equation. Although I have zeros on the for the X1 and X4. And so on for the rest of them, this is the the ratio constraint where you have negative. The coefficient for x one minus one point to one and one for two and three and minus one point one point twenty four x four. So that's the implementation of this constraint. And finally, the summation of all of them must be equal to 70000. My objective is to maximize profits, so I will multiply the coefficients by the decision variables and then I will include all of this as left hand side to be to meet the right hand side requirement. Keep in mind that I have sometimes less than or equal to, sometimes greater than or equal to. And in the last case, I have equal to. So I can't just select all of this range because I will have to have different signs. So in this case, I took each one to be a separate constraint. You can select the first two as one constraint or one range of constraints. The second tool as another range and the third one will be equal. [00:11:25:15] In this case, I just selected each shell represented as a separate. It has separate entry in solver, so that's the equal sign constraint. This one is less than or equal to the right hand side as a less than. And over here, for instance, this one is greater than or equal to the right hand side. The 21000 and so on for all of them, make sure that the signs are selected carefully because you don't want to reverse a sign and make all the decision variables as non-negative and solve it as a linear programming problem and their options, you don't need to change anything. Although we have this selected ignore integer constraints, it doesn't you don't have any integer constraints in solver. So in this case, in this particular example, so selecting this or not, selecting it doesn't matter, but just to be just to to ensure that this is a linear programming, not integer programming. That option is selected and when I had sole. It gives me. The optimal solution and this optimal solution says that you need to invest in X three and X four x three and X4 if we go back to my slides they represents or over here, they represent the amount invested in Treasury bills and and growth stock X3 and X4, none in CDs and none in municipal bonds. Although if you look at the coefficient for the profit, the return of investment in X one, the highest actually the highest is one. [00:13:05:08] However, it wasn't selected as part of the optimal solution because it this is a better objective function. This is a better objective function value and it will so, so sometimes your intuition may not be really correct if you say this is the highest profit. So most likely I will end up investing in X one. You have to consider the other constraints and other constraints. They force this variable to be equal to zero in an optimal solution. So let's just be careful not to make a judgment before we solve the problem, because sometimes it's not really that easy to figure out the solution. This is why we need a computer algorithm to find the optimal solution for us as a scenario, as a potential scenario that you can try, you say, Well, what if you don't have to invest all of the 70000? Uh, is there a can I can I just say, well, invest as you know, as much as necessary to maximize the profit? In this case, what do I need to do? You can pause here for a second and think about what you can, how you can implement this, where you don't have to invest all of the 70000. In this case, to implement this condition, I will just change the sign from equal to to less than or equal to which means maximum you can invest £70000. [00:14:33:21] So if I go back to silver and I change this equal sign to less than or equal to. Seventy thousand and then I had sold again. It doesn't really change anything to the solution simply because there is really no benefit to saving any of the investment, not to invest it. Everything that you invest will give you a benefit. So solver will clearly try to maximize the benefit or the profit, and therefore it will invest all of the £70000. But in some cases there could be a cost associated with the investment. If there is a cost associated with the investment, potentially the cost can be somehow high for some. For some investment types where you may say it is less, it is more profitable to not to invest all of the money and just leave some of it. Because if I force the model to invest everything, I will end up investing in some type that has a high cost and that may not be good for the profit. You can you can imagine some other scenarios where you want to diversify the portfolio and you want to also balance the risk, so there could be some additional data about risk involved. And you may want to minimize the risk, not necessarily just the profit. You may include the risk as part of your model, but a more constraints you have. [00:16:02:27] The more you can plug in these constraints in your mathematical model and implement them in Excel to give you the optimal solution. So the solution, the optimal solution that you get in this snapshot is based on that model in Excel, and that would be that would be the solution and not also here that fractional values are allowed so I can invest a I don't have to invest in whole stocks. It can be. You can. We're assuming that you can buy a fraction of a stock and because the amount that you will end up investing in is high. So in this case, you're investing in X3 38000, adding one more stock may end up being infeasible. However, the clearly rounding down may not really affect the optimal solution that much so it may be very realistic to solve this as a linear program and then round it down so that you don't exceed the the total amount of investment. Or if you end up rounding up, you may have to invest a little more than 70000. But keep in mind that the linear program model doesn't necessarily do this for you. You have to rationalize this yourself. So in other words, if I round up, I may end up with an investment that's slightly above 70000 and the model will tell you that's that's an infeasible solution because you violated this constraint.",3180,"[ 0.00545084 -0.00049366  0.00010201 ... -0.00132082 -0.0221188

Linear Programming Modeling Applications - Marketing System,4.4,LP-ME,"Title: Linear Programming Modeling Applications - Marketing System; Description: Linear Programming Modeling Examples - Marketing Application; Transcript: [00:00:01:18] Let's take a marketing application of linear programming. Suppose you have a company that's allocated a budget of $100000 to to a marketing campaign to market its products where they can run TV commercials, radio commercials, newspapers, ads to reach their potential customers. The conditions that we have, we have some constraints where the TV time is limited to four commercials. We cannot run more than four commercials on TV. We cannot run more than 10 commercials on radio, and we cannot run more than seven ads in the paper. The total number of commercials for all three marketing channels is limited to 15, so in total, I cannot exceed 15 commercials. The data for the problem is the number, the number of people that a TV commercial will reach is 20000 people and it will cost $15000. The radio commercial will reach 12000 people and will cost $6000, and the newspaper ad will reach 9000 people and will cost 4000 people $4000. And what we are interested in is maximizing the number of people who will see our products, basically the exposure. So this is the column that I want to be. I want to focus on with respect to the objective function. Given that I have to respect the the condition I listed earlier, so if I define my decision variables to be x one, the number of TV commercials next to a number of radio commercials and extreme number of newspaper ads, then my objective function can be formulated as follows 20000 people by the number of commercial ads on TV or a number of commercials on TV. [00:01:53:25] 12000 people multiplied by how many ads I will put on radio and 9000 multiplied by how many ads I publish in the paper that will give me the total number of people who will see my products. The conditions listed earlier can be formulated as follows I cannot exceed the budget of 100000, and this budget is consists of the cost for each type of marketing or each type of commercial or ad. So in case of the TV, it costs me 15000 per ad or per commercial. If I have X1 commercials, then I multiply 15000 by x one plus 6000 by the number of radio commercials and 4000 by the number of ads in the paper. The total amount must not exceed $100000. Also, I have three constraints on the limitations of the marketing channels I have. I cannot have more than four TV commercials. I cannot have more than 10. Um, radio commercials, and I cannot have more than seven paper ads in the paper. And also the total number of ads X1, X2 Extreme must not exceed 15. And everything, of course, is either zero or positive. No, I cannot have a negative ad published. So this is my LP model. This is my linear programming model. Very simple, but effective. Let's take a look at how we can do this, how we can arrive to this solution. I will talk about both the LP solution and integer solution by using Excel. If I implement this in Excel. Where I initially, I don't know anything. [00:03:45:04] I'm going to start with all zeros. And this is the data given to me, a number of people exposed in all three types and the the the cost of each type of of marketing this is given to me. My objective is to maximize the number of people that my ads reach to, which is basically the sum products of the number of people per ad multiplied by the number of ads. Here are my decision variables in the yellow cell and that I want to maximize and my my constraints are that I cannot exceed four TV ads, 10 radio commercials and seven ads in the paper. So these cells really have nothing but the numbers of different types of marketing, so this cell is simply pointing to the cell. I didn't have to have these. I can simply use a constraint on this directly, but it makes the spreadsheet more readable this way. So I'm just saying that this cell is equal to this cell and I'm going to enforce a constraint on these cells. The last one, which is the budget it is the sum of or the total number of ads. It's the sum of all types. So if I include them in the same formula, it will add up this cell. Plus this plus this, you could have alternative. Alternatively, you could have just selected this cell plus this cell plus the cell. I use the sum function because it's more readable. It just adds up all the cells in this range, and the cost is the sum product of the cost per ad multiplied by the number of ads. [00:05:28:05] So the cost in this case is not an objective, but rather a a a constraint and the right hand side, I cannot exceed 100000, I cannot exceed 15 ads and I cannot exceed the limitations on each type of ads that iron insolvent. When I go to data, then hit solver, I will select the green cell here as my objective function to maximize and my decision variables are the active cells here that you see. By the way, there is no significance for zero point zero zero or just the zero. It's just the format of the cell happen to be this way. And the constraints are that all of this must be less than or equal to the right hand side. But I hand hindsight over here, so I have really four or five constraints one two three four five. But I can select them as one range and to make sure that I don't forget the non negativity constraint I check off, I check on this box. All variables are not negative and I use the simplex solver because this is a linear model. The judges for nonlinear models and the evolutionary it's a it's a solver that will find a good solution, but not necessarily optimal and their options. I can always select this ignore integer constraints because I don't have any integers in the model. And when I had solved solver gave me the optimal solution where all constraints are satisfied, if I say OK to accept the values, the solution tells me to run 1.8. [00:07:03:22] Tv ad 10. Radio ads and um. And three point one to newspaper ads, actually, if I change the format of the cell to in terms of the number, I just make it a two digits to be consistent. It still tells me 10 10 radio commercials. So that's really the optimal solution with a number of people, maximum number of people, 285. In other words, given the constraints that we have, the maximum number of people you can reach is 180 5000. The cost of this marketing will be 100000. Exactly because there is a benefit for spending all of our budget. However, the optimal solution is not very practical when we have hundreds or thousands of units and the decision variables. It's OK to have a fraction because rounding down the number does not affect the solution that much. But in this case, 1.8 ad is a is a small number, so going up to two or going down to one may make a big difference. Ideally, we would like to make this true, and maybe these three, however, by making this to let's see what's going to happen to my budget. Ok, suppose that I say, OK, I'm going around this and let's run two TV commercials, OK, I increased my exposure. However, if you look at your budget here now, you are up to one or two thousands, which is more than 100000. Then you may say, Well, let me then round this down to three instead of three point one eight two. [00:08:46:04] And still, I'm at a one or two budget. Still violating the constraint surrounding the numbers in this case is not really helpful. You really have to do a lot of iterations and there is no guarantee you will hit the optimal solution as an integer. So if I go back to my original solution with a fraction. I may have to play around with these numbers and get the radio commercials into the mix and keep playing with them so that I don't violate the constraints. Instead of spending a lot of time doing that and we're not guaranteed an optimal solution, we can make this convert this to an integer program in which you can enforce a constraint on these cells to say these must be integers. This is the topic of another of another module, however. Let's go ahead and actually look at this scenario and how to do it because we're going to eventually do it in another lecture. So under solver, I can add another constraints. In fact, this has already been done on your new spreadsheet and a separate sheet, which is called marketing integer. And in this case, again, I don't I start with. Zero zero zero. And to be consistent, let me just make this. So you will see this as all of them are the same, have the same format and under solver, if you noticed that I did the exact same thing, except now I have a constraint here that basically enforces these cells to be integers. [00:10:30:06] Let me go ahead and delete this constraint just so that I show you how you would do it. So if I add. These cells and I will select from the dropdown menu the word or the term end, which means integer are clearly you can have some other possibilities. You can have binary buy in for a binary and this is for all different conditions, meaning all the numbers must be different. In this case, we just need an integer. And then I would say OK and I would hit solve and it finds a solution for me, an integer solution. Make sure that in the solver and their options, you turn off this condition. Ignore integer constraints. If you keep this, it will still give you a fractional a fractional value. So we want to make sure that this is unchecked. And then I say OK, and then I had solved, and that gives me a an integer solution. Notice what happened? It bumped up the number of TV commercials. It bumped up the newspapers ads and down the radio commercials that kept me within the same budget and gave me a little bit of less exposure to people. The products are less the number of people that these products are. These products reach to is less than before. The first one was 185. However, if you want your values to be absolutely integers, then you have to accept the fact that the objective function will be compromised. Keep in mind that the more you add constraints, the more the worse the objective function will be. [00:12:08:21] Or it may not change, but it will not improve. There is no improvement. As you add constraints, it may stay the same or get worse. I want to point out one one more thing, and this will get emphasized in the future, where you need to add a constraint here that you see in red that says all variables are integers. Not only that, they are zero or above, they are integers, and this will turn this problem into an integer program and we will see this topic in in in other modules. So it's important here to the point to emphasize that approximating a linear programming optimal solution doesn't necessarily guarantee an optimal integer solution to the problem. In both cases, the problem is linear. In both cases, I use in solver the Help Solve the Simplex LP. I'm sorry, the Simplex LP, which is a linear solver. It's it's still a integer. However, the the complexity of the problem changes dramatically, meaning the algorithm that needs to solve this problem requires a lot more time for this small problem. You don't really see that the solver spent a lot more time because it's a small, tiny problem, but in larger problems, you will see that. So that's the how you do it in Excel. And this is how we got to the snapshot that you see the snapshot that you see here where this is the LP solution and this is the integer solution.",2525,"[ 0.01403967  0.01351629  0.00311738 ...  0.00340851 -0.01937815

Linear Programming Modeling Applications - Transportation System,4.5,LP-ME,"Title: Linear Programming Modeling Applications - Transportation System; Description: Linear Programming Modeling Examples - Transportation Application; Transcript: [00:00:01:26] We cover now an application of transportation using linear programming, suppose that we have TV sets that we need to ship from three warehouses located in Cincinnati, Atlanta and Pittsburgh to three retailers in New York, Dallas and Detroit. And the supply and demand information is known beforehand. The shipping cost is also known the shipping cost per TV set, and the objective is to meet the demand with the minimum transportation cost. That's a typical transportation problem. So the data that's provided to us ahead of time is that we have three warehouses from which we can ship one in Cincinnati with a capacity of 300. Tv sets the time unit can be per week per month. Whatever time unit that we we have given that we are consistent across the board with time units. In Atlanta, we have another warehouse with a capacity of 200 TV sets and in Pittsburgh we have another warehouse with 200. Tv sets and capacity, so the total capacity that we have is 700. The retailers that are requesting this, these TV sets are located and located in New York, Dallas and Detroit. So we're going to refer to this as ABC could have used the notation of one to three, just like here one to three. And the amount of demand in New York is 150, 250 in Dallas and 200 in Detroit. As you noticed, the amount of demand is less than the capacity, but that's not necessarily the case all the time. We could have had the same total demand to be the same as the capacity, the total capacity. [00:01:50:04] The shipping cost is given to us in this table where if we ship one TV from the first warehouse to the first retailer, it will cost $16 to the second $118 and so on. If I ship from, let's say, Pittsburgh, which is Warehouse three to Dallas, it will be $15 a TV sets. And so I said and so on. And our objective is to minimize the total cost transportation costs. Typically, our objective will be maximizing profit. But in this case, we have only the cost information and we want to do this this. We want to solve this problem by minimizing the total transportation costs, and we must meet the demand. Of course, we must meet the demand, but also we cannot exceed the capacity of our warehouses. So that's typical transportation problem. And let's see how we can model it with linear programming. This can be represented as a a network, a network topology. And if I define my decision variable to be exigé to represent the number of TV sets shipped from I 2J, where I can, represents the warehouse and represents the retailer so I can take values of one to three and they can take values of ABC. As you can imagine, we can. We have a the first warehouse with capacity or supply capacity of 300. This is the second warehouse and third warehouse with their capacities and for the demand. These are my demand numbers. I can ship from one to eight and that amount will be x 1a. [00:03:39:22] That's my decision variable. I can ship from one to B, and the amount would be 1b x 1b and to to, let's say, from warehouse two to retailer A, it will be X two and so on. For all of them. Ok, so any amount that I ship along the arc that's drawn here will represent the value of the decision variable that I'm trying to determine the optimal value that I'm trying to to determine. There is no restriction on, at least in this example. There is no restriction on whether a certain retailer must receive only from one supplier or more than one supplier. So the general case is that we may receive from any of these warehouses as long as we meet the demand of that retailer. So to develop our model, all what I need is to define the appropriate decision variable exposure in this case and the. Objective function will be minimizing the total cost, so the cost is the the cost per unit from one to from retailer one to from warehouse one to retailer A multiplied by how many sets I ship. So $16 by the number of sets I ship from, from warehouse one to retailer B again 18 per unit multiplied by the number of units and so on for the rest of them. So these numbers that I took from the coefficients I took from all the parameters cost parameters for transportation I took from this the matrix that I showed earlier. [00:05:35:28] Multiplied by the decision, variables that I need to determine optimally the constraint the first set of constraints represents the supply constraints where I cannot exceed the maximum capacity of a certain warehouse and all of the warehouses and the demand constraint. A set of constraints is that I need to meet the demand on that and that for that retailer. So for instance, if I take the first constraint. Well, this is anything that I ship from warehouse one to any of the retailers to a, B or C must be the total amount must be less than or equal to 300. So if I go back to my chart here, anything that's going from one to any of the retailers, so x 1a plus x one, B plus x y and Z must not exceed the 300, so it's less than or equal to 300 the same thing for the second one. Anything I ship out of the second warehouse X to X to be X to see it must be less than or equal to 200 and so on for all three of them. As far as the demand, anything that's going into retailer E or the note that represents retailer E must be equal to 150. So for instance, if you look at retailer anything that's coming into this node. Anything that's going into a which is, in this case, x one x two A. X three A must be equal to 150. And the same thing for the other two constraints. [00:07:12:19] So now I have two sets of constraints, one for the supply, one for the demand. And of course, the non negativity constraint is that x IG must be either zero or a positive number. That's my mathematical model. And that's all what I need to solve this problem to know what's the optimal amounts to ship so that I minimize the total transportation costs? To do this in Excel, this is a snapshot of the optimal solution. Let's switch back to excel. In Excel, these are my parameters for the cost per unit. They are given this is my demand. This is my demand, which is given to me as well, and they and the capacity is also given to me, which is the right hand side of my constraint, my supply constraints, the yellow areas are the decision variables and initially I do not know the answers so I have. I can start with all zeros. These are my decision variables. The total amount shipped. Are going to need. I'm going to need this formula, so I sum up everything that ships out of Cincinnati. Everything that ships are of. Yeah, Atlanta and Pittsburgh. I add them up. And each of these cells, so the total amount must be less than or equal to the right hand side of the supply, which is 300, 200 and 200. And on the receiving end, the total amount the total number of TV sets received in New York. The summation of that must be equal to the demand constraint. [00:08:51:20] What I have here is a cell that points back to the demand data, and this way I it's just I could have just selected these to be my right hand side for the demand. It's just this way. It's a little more readable and I can easily enter it in solver. So the total amount shipped in to New York, the total amount shipped into Dallas. This total amount, which is the sum of the column, must be equal to 250, which is right here. The demand and this sell points to it. The the the objective function is in the green cell and what it says that the sum product of the coefficients by the decision variables is my total transportation cost. Well, this function will do is that it will take the first cell. 16. Multiply it by the first cell and the second matrix. Take the second cell of the first Matrix eight Matrix 18 multiplied by the second cell and the second matrix and so on for the first row. Then for the second row, it will take the corresponding value of the coefficient multiplied by. The decision variable and the second row, first cell and so on for all of them, so this is the the sum product function, and that's really my objective function that I'm trying to minimize. What you see here is just a snapshot of the model itself so that you don't have to go back and forth to the slide. You can look at it over here. So what this model tells us that I want to minimize the transportation costs. [00:10:20:27] However, I cannot exceed my supply and I must meet my demand. If it happened that the data is inconsistent and I don't have enough supply to meet the demand in this model, we will end up with an infeasible solution. Solver will give us a feasible solution. So let's solve first this using Excel. If I go to my solver and click on data and then go to solver in case sometimes it's all in Excel, similar to this case, you don't see solver, hear all what you need to do is to go and activate it, so go to go to your options. Add ends. And let go and then select solver and in the first in this case, somehow it got this deactivated, but I'm going to activate it again, so I deactivated it and then I will activate it again. And that should do that. Should that should do it. Now, solver shows up on my screen and if I click on Solver. My objective function is the green cell, and I'm minimizing my decision variables are here, the changing cells, what do you see in the yellow area? And my two areas of constraints are the demand and the and the demand and the supply. So the supply, the demand constraint is here where it says the total amount received in this range of cells must be equal to the total amount of demand given to me, which is right here or these are cells that they point to the given data up here. [00:12:03:16] And the second one, not here, that the sign is that it must be equal to the second set of constraints is that the total amount shipped from each of the retailers must be less than or equal to the capacity or the supply of that retailer. And of course, I make sure that my variables are not negative by selecting this option. My solver is LP Simplex LP and their options. I can choose to ignore the integer constraints, but we don't have integer constraints. So whether you select this or not, it won't really matter. And then if I had sold, it gives me that tells me that all constraints and optimality conditions are met or satisfied, and that would be my optimal solution of $7300 in transportation costs. The optimal solution is to ship 200 units from Cincinnati to Detroit and 200 from Atlanta to Dallas, and 150 from Pittsburgh to New York and 50 from Pittsburgh to Dallas. If I look at my demand, I got 150 in New York. I got the 250 in Dallas, although I got them from two different sources. It's OK because the problem doesn't tell us that you need to have a single source. And finally, I got my 200 in Detroit. Let's take a look at the capacity. How much did we ship? We shipped 200, 200 200. The supply here, maximum supply is 300, 200 200. So really, we have an extra 100 TV sets that they are left in Cincinnati. [00:13:42:28] And you could have predicted that in the US when we looked at the slide where it shows that the capacity is 105 sets higher than the demand. So we were expecting to have an extra capacity of 100, but we really didn't know where this extra capacity would be at. It could have been at some other source. It doesn't have to be. It's difficult to predict ahead of time, except for simple problems where the extra capacity will end up being. If I suppose that I have in Cincinnati, I have a total capacity of 100 instead of 300. I want to show you an example of invisibility. So the total amount of demand, if you add up these numbers, it is 600. The supply is 700 as a total. Suppose that we have a supply only of 500, 100 and two and two in this case, because I'm enforcing the demand to be met, solvers should really come back and tell me there is no feasible solution for what you're trying to do. You don't have enough supply to meet the demand. So to verify this, I can run the model again after I change this number. I don't change anything to the constraints and I had solved and solved will tell me couldn't find a feasible solution simply because we don't have enough supply to meet all of the demand. So it's important that you look at the message that you get from solver, not just to accept immediately and hit OK. [00:15:13:06] Because even if I hit OK, it will give me a solution. But that solution is is not feasible. This solution, the total, the total demand is not met. So it is not here in case of New York, but it's not met in Dallas. It's 100 units short and you don't want to make any conclusions about the infeasible solution, whether it makes sense and whether you can use it to make sense of something else. Because it doesn't. It didn't necessarily drop that 100 units from Dallas for a good reason. It could be a good reason to drop Dallas in particular. But maybe it's not the best 100 units to to drop given given the cost. So we don't want to use an infeasible answer because we don't know at what point solver stopped. We don't want to use an infeasible answer to make any interpretation of the answer. Once you see an infeasible solution, this problem is infeasible. I cannot solve it. It is not possible to have a solution. If I go back and make the supply equal to 200 instead of 300 now, I have exactly a balanced problem of supply equal to demand and I can find a solution. All demand is met the same cost the original. The original supply was 300. But notice here that the solution remained the same because these additional 100 TV sets were unnecessary. I didn't really need them. They were still sitting there in a realistic case. There will be a cost to having these additional 100 units, and that cost can be part of the objective. [00:17:00:10] So in this case, if I had said 300 or 400 or 500, it didn't matter didn't affect the objective function or the solution, because I assume that there is no extra cost for having these 100 units in the warehouse in Cincinnati. And this is how we got the solution that you see on this on the slide. You can play additional scenarios with this and see what you can get. If, let's say, if you want to try a scenario where you don't want to ship anything from one source to one specific source to a specific destination. So let's say you don't want to ship anything out of Atlanta to Detroit. So in this case, the solution happened to be zero already, but let's let's take these Five-O units. Ok, let's take these 50 units and try a scenario if I don't want to ship anything from Pittsburgh to Dallas for whatever reason. Ok. What I can do to prevent this, and without making any changes to the structure of the model, I can just increase this cost over here and make it very prohibitive. I make the cost $150 or $200, and if that's the only way to do it, then it will still select it and will increase the cost significantly. But if there is another way to meet the demand from to meet the Dallas demand, then it will do it. Let's try this example and see what happens with the scenario. [00:18:38:05] So suppose that I don't want to get shipped anything from Pittsburgh to Dallas. It is. There is no transportation mechanism on that week or whatever, so I can just make this cost high. Let's make it 150 instead of 50. And then I can't resolve the problem and see whether solver will give me a good solution or not. Now what it did, it found the solution. The cost is a bit higher. So it's 7000 for 50. But what it did, it shipped the 50 units that shipped earlier from Pittsburgh to Dallas. It shipped them from Cincinnati to Dallas because now the cost to ship to Dallas from Cincinnati is small, which is 18 compared to 150. So it shifted where the flow will go. And that's the optimal the new optimal solution. Clearly, the cost will be higher a little bit by $150, but these 150 are not really the same as the 150 additional cost. I could have made this $5000. And I would still get the same solution. Of additional $150, so that was just a coincidence that I increased the cost by 150. And what I'm saying here is make the cost high enough that it will be too high compared to the rest of the possibilities, and solver will not pick that route because it will make the objective function very high. You can try some additional scenarios, but that's the the the the idea of blocking a certain route from taking place between one source to another to another destination.",3760,"[ 0.02133325 -0.01474643  0.00038311 ... -0.00273051 -0.02828303

Linear Programming Modeling Applications - Blend System,4.6,LP-ME,"Title: Linear Programming Modeling Applications - Blend System; Description: Linear Programming Modeling Examples - Blend Application; Transcript: [00:00:01:15] Another application of linear programming as a blunt application. In this application, suppose that you have a company that produces three grades of oil super premium and extra, in which the there are three components that are used components one, two and three with some specifications, with some ratios and with some amounts that they need to satisfy for each grade. And this is given the next slide. The company wants to produce at least 3000 barrels of each grade, so 3000 barrels of super, 3000 barrels of premium, 3000 barrels of extra grade. The maximum availability of each component is also given to us. Basically, the raw material that that go into the the different grades, it has a certain amount of availability that we cannot exceed and the selling price for each grade is also given to us. And as well as the cost of each component is also given to us in this table. So what we see here, these are the components that constitute the different grades. The different amounts of each component will determine what level of grade it will. The final product will be super premium or extra for each component. I have a maximum availability given to me. So, for instance, in component one, I have 4500 barrels available per day. And it cost me $12 per barrel, and four component to this is the availability, and this is the cost and the same thing for a component three. I have some restrictions or the the way I distinguish between the different grades a super premium or extra is by the amounts that go into each one of them. [00:02:01:28] The ratios of the different components. So for instance, for the car in case of super. At least 50 percent of component one component one must go into a super grid and no more than 30 percent of component to look, there is no restriction on the remaining amount of component three for the premium, at least 40 percent of one and no more than 25 percent of three of a component three. And finally, the extra at least 60 percent of one and at least 10 percent of to this is the selling price for each grid. So note here that we are given the selling price for each grade because this is what happens when you sell the super grade, the barrel of super grade, you charge this amount. The cost is linked to the components, not necessarily the grade. So I have the selling price of each grade of oil, but I have the cost of each component that go that goes into a certain grade. So what we want is to maximize the profitability, so to formulate a and linear program for this problem, let's define our decision variables and the decision variables can be defined as the quantity of each component that goes into the certain grade. So basically, exigé is the barrels the number of barrels of component I used in motor oil grade j per day. So I can take the values of one to three because it refers to the component number and Jay can take the values of S P or E, which refers to the Grade I could have also used as one to three, but I have to distinguish that one two three four j mean the grade of super premium or extras, respectively, and I represents the components, so it's better to use in this case, better to use numbers and letters to refer to different things. [00:04:16:04] The grades and letters. And the components in numbers. My objective is to maximize profitability. Profitability is the difference between the amount, the revenue, which is the selling price by the amount I sell, minus the cost of the components. So let's take a look at the revenue terms. This is the revenue term for the Super. This is the revenue term for premium and this is for extra. So where do I get this from? Basically, the selling price that's given to me on here. Twenty three for super and multiplied by all the components that go into super. So whether I have a certain number of barrels from component one, component two or component three that go into super, I multiply that by 23. That gives me the revenue for the barrels of super oil. And the same concept applies for the premium. The selling price is twenty by the total amount of components going into the premium and finally 18 for extra multiplied by the total amounts or total number of barrels going into of the different three different components going into extra. [00:05:28:20] I need to take out the cost of the components that go into the different grades. So minus this is the cost of. Component one, going into any of the three grids, I I because I don't know yet which how much of each component will go into a specific grade, I just multiply the cost of the barrel of a component one by the amounts going into all three grades. So when I add up the X one x plus x 1p plus x one e, basically what I'm saying, the total amount of component one that's going into the three different grades. Multiply that by 12 per barrel, which is the cost that you see over here. Ok, well, that gives me the cost of component one going into whatever grade, so it's going to all three grades, if it doesn't go into specific grade, then it will take a value of zero. So I subtract the cost of the component one going into any of the grades. Also, I subtract the cost of component two going into the three grades of super premium and extra minus. Finally, the cost of component three going into the three grades that would be the net profit for my problem, and that will be my objective function. When you simplify this, you end up with 11 X1's plus 13 X2's and so on to the end, because you can when you simplify this, you break this up and now you you add the terms together or subtract the terms and 23 X1's minus 12 X1's that gives me the 11 X1's and so on. [00:07:15:28] So that's my objective function. Let's now take a look at the constraint. What are the limitations of this problem on this problem? First of all, I cannot exceed the maximum availability, so the maximum availability can be represented by the following three constraints X1's. Plus x OnePlus X one e cannot exceed forty five hundred barrels. So what is this left hand side? It's the amount of component one that goes into super, plus the amount of component, one that goes into premium plus that that goes into the grid of extra must not exceed 4500. Go back to the table. So you see component one is limited to maximum availability of 4500 regardless where it is used, if it's used in super premium or extra. And that's exactly what this constraint does. Similarly, you can formulate the other two constraints depending on the the availability given to us. So you can easily see that, for instance, component three, the total amount of component three that goes into super premium or extra must be less than or equal to 3500. So we got to take, we take, we took care of the availability constraint. Let's now take a look at these ratios that you see over in this table are how we can model them. These are a little bit trickier than the usual constraints. So let's take a look at the first one, which is we call the super the super grid constraints, where at least 50 percent of component one and no more than 30 percent of component to take a minute and think about how you can model this constraint. [00:09:01:03] Basically, you have two constraints. You have at least 50 percent of component one and no more than 30 percent of component two. You can pause here and think about how you can formulate this ratio constraint. I'll walk you through this now. So the question is, how did we arrive to the constraint that you see on this slide? The zero point five x one x minus zero point five x two x minus zero point five x three. So basically. A super ratio. Constraints. Basically, what this constraint is, the amount of component one in the first case, the amount of component one that goes into super, the ratio between component one that goes into super compared to the other components, which is total components. X two s. This is an ask, don't confuse it with a five plus x three s must be greater than or equal to 0.5. What this ratio tells me that the amount of component one that goes into the super grade must be greater than or equal to 50 percent compared to the total. I don't explicitly say this is a constraint, but this is implied that if you say I need to have at least 50 percent of that component, then 50 percent compared to it compared to the total amount. When you simplify this, X1's is greater than or equal to 0.5. [00:10:50:15] The reason I need to simplify it because I don't want to divide decision variables by each other. That makes the problem not linear, so I want to simplify it to make it linear. So this would be x one s right here, plus 0.5. X one x two x. Plus point five x, please further simplify this by moving it to the left hand side so that we have it in the standard format that gives me. Point five x one x minus 0.5. X two x minus 0.5 x three x must be greater than or equal to zero, and that gives me the first constraint. The second constraint is that the amount of component two in super can must be less than or equal to 0.3. So, so this is the first constraint in super. The second one is that I have to have X two x component to compare to the total amount of X one s. Plus X two x plus x three x must be less than or equal to point three. So if I simplify this again, I don't want to divide decision variables by each other. I will have x two s. Less than or equal to point three x one x plus point three x two x plus zero point three. X yes. And putting everything in a standard format, moving the right hand side terms to the left, that will give me X. Uh, point seven. Point seven x two s. [00:13:01:29] Minus 0.3. X one x minus 0.3. X three s must be less than or equal to zero, and that is my second constraint. For the super great. So when you look at this constraint or two constraints here now, you understand where these are coming from, these strange ratios are coming from the the constraints that are given to us in the beginning of the problem. Let's go back up a little bit and look at the second set of constraints at least 40 percent of one and no more than 25 percent of three. These are the conditions for the premium grade. So if I want to implement this or formulate this, I should say I will end up with these two constraints where you see premium ratio constraints over on these two for these two constraints. And again, the same concept here where if you have. So the premium. Premium ratio. Constraints. Where the ratio of component one that goes into premium compared to the rest of the components that go into premium. X 3p must be at least 40 percent so greater than or equal to 0.4 percent. So if you simplify this, you will end up with zero point six. X1 p minus point four x 2p minus 0.4. X sleep, and that represents the first constraint of the premium, and the last one is that similar concept x 3p divided by the total amount of, uh, components that go into. The premium. Must be less than or equal to zero point twenty five, and you end up with the constraint when you simplify it. [00:15:31:22] Point seventy five x 3p minus point twenty five x one p minus zero point two five x two p and that's my second premium constraint. So you can compare these to the ones that you see on the slide and. You can see here the premium 0.6 minus 0.4 minus 0.4 x 3p, and the second one is seventy five point seventy five. Um three p x three p minus point to five minus zero point five extra p and X 1p and x 2p. So this is the premium ratio constraints. I'll leave the last two constraints for you to as an exercise, so just make sure that you follow a similar idea of doing the last two constraints at least 60 percent of component one and at least 10 percent of component to the same approach, like what we just did. So verify these two constraints for the extra grade. And finally, the the constraint of minimum production where the statement says here the company wants to at least produce 3000 of each grade, so the total amount of components going into the super. X1's Plus X two x plus x three x must be greater than or equal to 3000 the same thing for the premium, the same thing for the extra. And of course, never forget that the non negativity constraint exigé for all of four variables must be greater than or equal to zero must be greater than or equal to zero. [00:17:26:22] And. To do this in Excel. To do this and excel, this is the final solution. A snapshot of the solution, I'll show you quickly how we implemented this in Excel. I have here my ex one, as initially I start with zeros. I don't know the solution. So this is my X1's X two x three x x one p through three p. And finally, the components for the extra grid. These are my decision variable. My profit is coming from the coefficients that you see here in the objective function that I just put also on the slide. So these. A coefficients are listed here for X1's, it's 11, four x two x, it's 13 and so on. And the objective function is simply that some product of the coefficients multiplied by the decision variables. My constraints here, the left hand side of my constraint first, the first three sets of constraint is the component, the availability, component availability. So basically saying X1's plus x OnePlus X one e must be greater than or equal to the right hand side, which is 4500. And. And the second component, the the maximum availability of the second component, is also obtained by adding up x two x plus x two plus x plus x two e. And so on. So for the availability, we have these three constraints. The ratios, the blend or the ratios are here for the super. It is. If you look at this formula right here, the easiest thing was to type in the coefficients multiplied by the decision variables. [00:19:32:21] It's although I don't like to type into the formula, the coefficients I like to select them from cells. But there wasn't an easy structure for this problem, where you have the coefficient list laid out in a in a in a in a way that will make it more readable. So I thought that this in this case, this particular case, typing in the options may be more readable and it will indicate which constraint is which. So in this formula, you see the point five by the X1's minus the zero point five by x two s minus the zero point five by x three s and the same thing for the second super constraint. The premium is here. Where you have 0.6 by X one p minus 0.4 by x 2p, minus 0.4 by x 3p and the same thing for the extra, you can verify this on your own. And finally, the minimum amount of production that must be produced is the summation of the the the super components. So don't confuse in the the minimum amount of production, which is the addition of components one, two and three that's going into super must be greater than or equal to 3000 and the premium. The addition of the components must be greater than or equal to three thousand. And the same thing for the extra. Don't confuse this minimum production with the maximum availability. The maximum availability not is that it is about the components. [00:21:06:07] So the component that's going into super premium or extra of component one must be less than or equal to 4500. However, the availability or the minimum production is per great. So the minimum production is per grade. This is why we add everything that has to do with super. We add it together and with the availability it's it's a function of component. And this is why everything that has to do with one component, one, we add it up together, whether it's super premium or extra. So it's really important to clearly define your decision variables, what they mean and use them very carefully. Because in many cases, you may have a model that may look OK on the surface, but actually when you translate it, it doesn't. It doesn't do the right job. So you can imagine if these were instead of one S1P one e they ended up being you end up putting everything in super, not in premium, maybe one as two as three s. That becomes the the minimum production constraint, not the availability constraints. So it's important to pay attention to that. And when I go to my solver. I just maximize the objective function in the green cell, maximize and the decision variables are right here and my constraints are listed here and some of them because I don't have one range of greater than or equal to or less than or equal to. I have them mixed up. I can input the different ranges independently. So I have here, for instance, the one cell and. [00:22:57:11] This is the third cell, but in this case, I have a range of cells that are greater than or equal to the right hand side. You could have if you want this to be a little more elegant, you could have manipulated these decisions. These constraints so that all of the equal inequalities have the same direction, so all of them are less than or equal to or greater than or equal to. And this way you can select the whole range. So you could have done manipulated the signs of each variable and then made sure that you have. Are all of these signs are the same either less than or equal to or greater than or equal to, and this way you can select one big range and then the right hand side will be this one. I think that the readability, though, is more important in this case. So. So if they it, you do a little bit more work on the excel where you input more than one constraint and. And but when someone looks at your work, they can link each constraint to with its inequality sign more easily than if you manipulated the signs and change the the manipulated the size of the equations over here and change this the direction of the inequality. Either way, we'll give you the right answer, but I thought that this makes the model more readable. So unsolved. When I hit, of course, they use the Simplex LP and their options, I choose to ignore any integer constraints, although I don't have integer constraints, but that's the by default that's checked on for LP problems. [00:24:50:14] And when I solve it gives me this total profit of seventy six thousand seventy six 800. And these are the amounts of barrels of each component and where it goes in which grade it goes to. If you want to know how much of component one went into the different grades, that is calculated right here because it's the addition of these three cells. So I use the maximum amount of components once that permitted for and if I want to know how much of component to. I also use the maximum. I didn't really use the maximum of component three because it is not beneficial to the model, it doesn't add to the profit. And these are the ratios. These numbers may not be may not be really easy to interpret in terms of physical meaning to or the real meaning to them. They are simply constraints based on their issues. So just make sure that they are satisfied. So for instance, this negative 300, it's less than zero. So it's fine. And the 750, it's less than zero. It's fine. I used the maximum amount of the minimum I did the the 3000 barrels a day or minimum production. And there was no more benefit to produce more than that. That was the outcome of the of the model. And this is where we got our optimal solution that you see [00:26:29:13] On the slide.",4371,"[ 0.00857778  0.00580404 -0.00184453 ... -0.0139727  -0.01843148

Linear Programming Modeling Applications - Multi-Period Scheduling,4.7,LP-ME,"Title: Linear Programming Modeling Applications - Multi-Period Scheduling; Description: Linear Programming Modeling Examples - Multi-Period Scheduling Application; Transcript: [00:00:01:07] Let's go over now an application of multiple scheduling, this type of application deals with the problem of planning the amount of production or service and organization where you need to know the level of production or service over a period of time or multiple periods that can be represented in weeks, months, days and so on. So suppose that we have a company that assembles computers and the production capacity is 160 computers per week. It can assemble 50 more computers on top of the 160 if they use over time. The cost of assembly is $190 per computer, using regular time and 216 per computer using overtime. So if they use the over time, the cost is to 60. If they use regular production, the cost is 190. They if they hold anything in inventory, the cost is $10 per computer per period, which is a week in this case, and no inventory can be held at the last period. So we don't want to have any inventory left at the end of the last period. Here is the data that we are dealing with in this problem. We have six week, six week period, a total period of six weeks. The the first week we need to assemble 105 computers, the second week we need to assemble 170 and so on for all six weeks. And what we would like to know is how to actually produce these computers, whether they are on regular time over time and whether we need to hold anything in inventory and carry it over from one period to another. [00:02:02:15] Sometimes it is more beneficial to produce more in a certain period, create an inventory and then use it for the second period. If our regular production and possibly our over time production capacity is not enough. It can be. I may have excess capacity in one period and lower demand so I can carry things in inventory. However, it will cost me an inventory cost. So I don't want to put things in inventory unnecessarily. I want to put them in. I want to store the computers in inventory if they are beneficial to my objective. And the objective here is to minimize the total cost. So I want to come up with a plan that meets this demand and I want to know how to produce them, how to assemble the computers via regular time over time, or to carry some inventory or a combination of both. So to start with defining our decision variables, if I define RJ as a variable that represents the regular production amount for week, Jay and Jay can go from one to six because I have six periods six weeks. Oj is the over time production level also goes from one to six. And finally, RJ is the extra computers that I will put in inventory in period J. So how much I'm going to store in the inventory to carry over to the next period? The objective function is to minimize the cost. So as you recall, it costs us $190 per computer on regular production. [00:03:41:20] So if I produce R1 at in the first week or two at the second week and so on for six weeks, then multiply this by 190. That gives me the the production costs on regular time. If I produce anything on over time, then I multiply the total amount of overtime over all six periods by the cost per unit or the assembly. Assembling a computer with over time, it costs us 260. And finally, if I store anything in inventory in the and the five periods, I multiply by 10 because it costs me ten dollars to carry a computer. Note that we don't have here I6 because part of the restriction is not to have inventory in the last period and we need to reflect that in our model. So that's my objective function and. The constraints are my constraint for this model. First, I cannot exceed my regular capacity of over time of regular time. So RJ, for each period, I must not exceed 160 computers in a week. So for each period RJ. So we repeat this constraint for each period. It has to be done for each period where our one is less than or equal to 60 160 and R2 is less than or equal to 160. So really, this constraint is a set of constraints, a set of six constraints. So we have to apply it for each value of G. I have six weeks, so I will have RJ less than or equal to 160 for every single period of these six. [00:05:22:25] And the same thing with over time, O.J. must be less than or equal to 150 computers per week that's applicable to all six periods. Now, the inventory constraints that are a little bit trickier to deal with. So let's take a look at how we came up with this set of constraints for to handle inventory. I'm going to demonstrate this on a notepad. So if I have, let's take a look at the first period, basically whatever I produce on regular time and first period, plus anything on overtime, that's the total amount of production, whether it's regular time or overtime. I really wanted to meet the demand of one or five. That's the demand in the first and the first period. I also would like for my model to have space for inventory so that it is beneficial for me to carry inventory from period one to period two. I have a placeholder for that inventory in my model. So what I want to do is to allow the model to include an inventory at this period i1 if necessary. If not, it will be zero. If it's not beneficial for the model, it will be zero. So by this, I say the total amount I produce based on regular time or overtime must meet the demand for the first period, plus any inventory that I may wish to carry for the next period. So this constraint then becomes R1 plus or one minus I one, because I want to put it in a standard format, of course, is equal to one or five in the second period. [00:07:14:00] So now I don't know whether there will be a period one, any inventory or not, but at least I have a placeholder for it in case if it is beneficial for me to hold computers in the inventory to carry over to the next period and the next period, the amount I produce in the next period and regular time, plus any overtime in the next year, plus any inventory I carry from the first period that was from the first period. Must be equal to the demand, which is 170 in this case. Plus, any inventory I would like to have in this period, which is period to that I would like to carry to the next period. When you put this in a standard format, it will end up being R2. Plus or two plus one minus I two is equal to one seventy. Similarly, I can do the third period, so what I have, what I produce in the third period plus any over time in the third period, plus any inventory I carry from the previous period, which is period two, must equal the demand. In this case, the demand for period three is 230. Plus, any inventory that I would like to carry in this period, which is three and carry over to period four and the same thing, you can put it in a standard format. [00:08:48:20] So it will be our three plus or three plus I two minus three is equal to two three and you do this for period four and period five. The same rationale you can verify this for yourself. And finally, I would like to do period six. So you do this for periods four and five for period six. Notice that we cannot. We're not allowed to carry inventory in period six. So the production I do in period six plus on regular time, plus the production on overtime, plus any inventory I have carried from the previous period, which is period five, must be equal to 2.50. And I do not allow for any additional inventory. So I don't put I6 on the right hand side because that problem requires that I do not carry any inventory at the last period. If we were required or it's OK, it was not mentioned that you can have or inventory or not, then you can include IE6. But specifically this problem, ask you not to carry in any inventory at the end. Going back to our model, you have the constraints, so I showed you the rationale of getting these constraints. Now it's time for us to implement them in an Excel model. And you see in this model, this is a snapshot of the optimal solution. Let me first go to excel and then we will see that solution, how we obtain the solution. An excel. In Excel, I have there are six periods here, six weeks. [00:10:28:04] These are my decision variables. Initially, I start with everything at level zero, so I don't know how much I should produce, and I don't know how much I should produce on over time and regular time and over time. What you see here is the regular capacity and the over time capacity, although it is the same value for all three six periods. I selected I chose to list the 160 as a regular capacity. I repeated this 164 each period. I could have just used one cell instead of six cells, but that makes our model more flexible. So in the future, if the same problem is presented to you, however, the level of regular capacity has changed because you have maybe an extra temporary employee or something here. You can change this value without really affecting the model. So all of a sudden you have the capacity to build 200 computers. You can change that value. In particular, if you have only one cell, then basically you are always restricting yourself to the same level of regular capacity at all periods. So I have the same rationale applies to the overtime capacity. So these are my capacities. These are given parameters. This total production is basically the summation of regular and over time production, I don't really need it for my model, but it is. It reflects how much I have in production and how much I have in inventory. And the addition of all of this will tell me how much, how many computers are available. [00:12:02:17] Also, the inventory is zero at the beginning. I don't know the values here. And the. But it is part of the decision variables and notice that I have only five of them because in the last period, I'm not supposed to have any inventory. My objective function is the sum product of the not the same product, the sum. Of my production multiplied by the cost of regular production, which is 190, so are multiplying the 190 by the total amount of total regular production and for the overtime to 60 by the total amount of overtime production. And finally, the inventory is 10 by the total amount of inventory. So basically in this formula, I sum up these three, I sum up these columns individually and multiply each one of them by the corresponding cost associated with it and. Now that I have my objective function, my constraint is our set of constraints are shown here. So basically, it's a straightforward implementation of these constraints. Over here, what I what what I have in terms of availability. What I have in terms of availability is the regular production, plus the overtime production minus the inventory at this at this period period one and in the second one. I have the production, a regular production plus overtime production. Minus or plus the victory from the previous period. Minus the inventory of the current period, I showed you the rationale for having this constraint this way. [00:13:59:10] All of these cells, they then follow the same logic except for the last one where you are not allowed to have inventory. So it will be the regular production plus overtime production plus any inventory from previous period. And you don't include anything about the inventory of the current period. These are the constraints that you see down here as far as. So these are the constraints implemented here. As far as the capacity, I can just simply include this in solver. So if I go to silver. You see. That the regular production, the regular production must be less than or equal to the regular production must be less than or equal to the regular capacity, which is right here. So every cell in the in this range, every cell in this range must be less than or equal to 160 and the same concept for the overtime. So every cell in this range active range must be less than or equal to 50. And finally, the availability constraint or the inventory constraints. Basically, it says that all computers available must be greater than or equal to the demand. The computer demand that's given to us, and of course, all decision variables must be non-negative, and I will use the Simplex LP software and their options. Always a good idea to check to make sure everything looks normal. I don't have any integers all in this problem. So when I had solved. So found a solution or constraints and optimality conditions are satisfied, which means this is an optimal solution and this is my objective function value. [00:15:49:26] It will cost 216 two hundred sixteen thousand three hundred. The they let's take a look at the level of production, so as you can see, I maximize the usage of my regular production, so I use the maximum amount because regular production is cheaper than using over time and also an all in case of over time. The first two periods, I didn't have to use anything, but then I needed to use some over time the minimum amount of over time to meet the demand. The inventory? Because here I was producing things on a regular production, I maxed the although the capacity or the demand is one or five, so I don't really need to produce 160 yet. I produce 260 and I carried the the difference between one 05 and 160, which is 55. I carried it in inventory. I paid $10 a piece for inventory costs, but that's still cheaper than having to hire overtime. So the same thing for the first two periods because the demand was not the demand was not as as high. So in the second period, I also produced the full capacity, although the demand is the demand is 170, actually. And the demand is 170, so I used the full capacity to meet 160 of that demand and then the other 10 are used from the existing inventory. This is why you see the amount left in the inventory is 45. [00:17:25:28] And then I didn't have any inventory in the in the period three and four. And finally, I had to carry some inventory 40. The demand was 150 here, so I used the full production. I use the full production of 160. I put some in the inventory to help me in the to help me in the four, to meet the to meet the demand. Of 250 in the last period, so I have some from the inventory and inventory and also I had to do, I had to do a little bit of over time. I had to do 50 units of over time. And since I have 40 already in the inventory, then I can meet my 250 demand. So that would be this is really known as production planning problem, and we use linear programming to find for to to come up with a plan what to produce for each period. So now you know that in the first week, you should produce at full capacity and do not have any over time the first two weeks and then plan on having some over time, regular times, always at full capacity, but have a plan on having some over time. Similar to the values we have here and also plan on carrying some inventory to help you. This is the plan that will minimize the total cost for this. The total cost for this assembly computer assembly company. And this is how we got the and this is how we got the snapshot that you see on this slide.",3361,"[-0.00273621 -0.00814123 -0.00283056 ...  0.00563753  0.00189883

Linear Programming Modeling Applications - Petroleum Refinery,4.8,LP-ME,"Title: Linear Programming Modeling Applications - Petroleum Refinery; Description: Linear Programming Modeling Examples - Petroleum Refinery; Transcript: [00:00:01:15] Let's now take a blunt application where a refinery, a petroleum refinery, blends four types of components into three grades of gasoline. Regular premium and diesel. So each one of these grades consist of. Well, the the four different components with different ratios and the maximum quantities available for each component type and the cost per barrel of that component is given here. So I have four components that get mixed up into different grades. These are the maximum availability in barrels per day, and this is the cost per barrel of each component. Now the to ensure that each grade has specific characteristics. There are some requirements that need to be met for each grade. So these requirements are and the selling price per barrel are given here. So in the regular grade, I cannot have less than 40 percent of component one, but no more than 20 percent of component two and I will sell a barrel for $12. And also, a regular regular grade must have no less than 30 percent of Component three. It doesn't have any restriction or requirement for component for the premium cannot have less than 40 percent of three. The no, not the diesel cannot have more than 50 percent of two and no less than 10 percent of one, and the rest is open. It doesn't have really any restrictions on that, and these are the selling price for regular premium and diesel. And what also, we have a demand requirement that we need to at least produce 3000 barrels of each grade of gasoline, of regular diesel and premium. [00:02:12:00] The management wants to, of course, optimize its profit by finding what the best or the optimal mix of the four components. And we need to formulate a linear programming models model and solve it. Using Excel. To start developing the model, let's first define our decision variables. If I define Exigé. As the number of barrels. Of component. I. And great, J. The amount of a certain component into a certain grade. This means that for regular for the regular grade, I will have a the total would be x one. That component, one that goes into regular plus component, two that goes into regular plus component, three that goes into regular plus component form that goes into regular for premium. This would be the total amount into a barrel of regular for a premium. It will be x one p plus x 2p plus x 3p plus x three 4p. And for Diesel. I have X one L Plus or similarly to X4 L, so L refers to diesel, so I want to maximize. My profit. So my profit. The interesting thing about this problem is that the profit is the difference between the cost and the the difference between the revenue and the cost. And if you notice here, the cost is given per component, but the revenue or the selling price is given per grade. [00:04:34:26] So we have to be careful here how we set up that difference between revenue and cost. So what I want to what I want to do is to maximize the profit. So I want to maximize the difference between maximize profit, which is equal to the difference between revenue minus cost, which means that I want to maximize the revenue it is for the regular grade. It's the selling price is twelve dollars a barrel multiplied by everything that goes into regular all the components that go into regular. So X one regular plus x two regular plus x three regular plus x for regular. That is what? Constitute a barrel of regular the amount that goes into all the different components that go into regular. That's the revenue from that plus the premium, so x1 p. All the way to X 4p plus. The diesel one L. All the way to X four L minus the cost, so that is the revenue side. The cost is nine. Now we have to be careful that the cost is fair component type, not pair grade type. So because the cost consist of the cost of the components, while when you sell something to your customers, you sell them a grade a mix of components. So the cost for the cost for component one is any grade that component one is used in. [00:06:37:08] So it will be x one regular plus x one premium plus x one diesel minus seven by x two regular. Plus extra premium plus access to diesel minus 12. By X3 regular plus X3 premium plus X3 diesel minus six by X4 regular plus six for premium. Plus. X4 Diesel. Six for regular plus, ex for premium plus ex for diesel and. And when you actually simplify this, if you break this down, you will end up with three. X one regular plus five x two regular. Plus zero. It's three regular plus six x for regular. So that is the net profit for the regular. Great. Plus. Nine x one premium plus 11 x two premium plus six x three premium. +12. X4 premium. Plus. Finally, for the diesel, it will be. One L plus three x two L minus. Two x three L. Plus. Four x four L. So that's my objective function, which is the net that would be the net profit, which is the difference between the the revenue and the and the cost. Now let's. See, how are we going to model the constraints? First, there is a demand constraint where the problem states that. The refinery has to produce at least 3000 barrels of each grade, so to model that anything, all the components that go into the regular. Plus, two regular plus three regular plus for regular must be greater than or equal to 3000. [00:09:57:09] Anything that goes into premium similarly. Export premium must be greater than or equal to three thousand. And finally, anything that goes into diesel. Is greater than or equal to 3000, so this represents the demand or the requirement on the production, the minimum production, the next set of constraints represents the availability of the components. So if we go back to the first slide, it says that these are the maximum amounts of components available per day. So to model that, I can simply say X, and if anything, that component one goes into so component one into regular, into premium or into diesel. Must be less than or equal to 5000 barrels, and the amount that goes for a component to amount that goes into premium diesel or regular must also be less than or equal to twenty four. Let's double check the amount here. Twenty four hundred. Battles and for the third component. Must be less than or equal to 4000 and finally for the fourth component. Must be less than or equal to 1500. So these are these constraints, the represents the maximum availability. Of components. Now, this is great demand. This is how much our minimum production, this is how much we are required to produce. Now they are the last set of constraints is basically the characteristics that must be that must be fulfilled. If you look here for the regular grid, we must satisfy these requirements for the premium. [00:12:31:06] This requirement and for the these are these two requirements. So to do that, and these are the trickier ones to do that. Let's take let's start with the regular, the first requirement on regular where it says you have to have no less than 40 percent of component one and no more than 20 percent of Component two. So for the regular requirement? That issue between component one to the rest of the components in the regular. So anything that goes into regular. Component two, component three and component four, the issue between component one to the rest of the components must be greater than or equal to 0.4. This is how we model this requirement. If I have a a container that has a mix of all four components that represent of the regular grade, then if I want to the issue of the first component to be more than 40 percent, it means that the. Amount of component one in that container that has the regular grade compared to the rest of the components must be greater than or equal to 40 percent. Now I need to put this in a standard format. I don't want to divide decision variables by each other. Otherwise I will end up with unnecessarily with a nonlinear problem. So to do that, I just simplify it. It will be x one R. Greater than or equal to 0.4 by. [00:14:19:11] X one R plus x two R plus x, three R plus x. For and to simplify it even further, we put all or to put it in a standard format, we are going to put all of our decision variables on the left hand side. So I will end up with zero point six x one R minus 0.4 x two R minus 0.4 x three R minus 0.4. Picks for are must be less than or equal to zero, and that is my first requirement. The second requirement on the regular grade is that the similarly the second component compared to the rest of the components in the regular. Must be. At least 20 percent. And similarly, when we simplify this, you will end up with. The following constraint minus point two x one R. Plus, 4.8 x two R minus 0.2 x three are. Minus point two x four R must be less than or equal to zero, so you can break this down yourself, arrange it yourself and make sure that you arrive to the same to the same constraint. And the third restriction on the regular grade is that no less than three percent of grade three. So if there is no if we have to produce no less than if you have to use no less than 30 percent of grade three in the regular in the regular grade, it means that iX3 are. [00:16:23:29] Compared to the rest of the components that go into. The regular grade must be greater than or equal to point three. And this leads you to the following inequality of minus 0.3 x one R minus 0.3 x two R plus 0.7. X three R minus 0.3 x four R must be greater than or equal to zero, and that is the third requirement on the regular. On the regular grid, please make sure that you rearrange these terms yourself and see if you can arrive to the same to the same inequality. Now let's take a look at the premium. Requirement the the characteristics of the premium. It says that they no less than 40 percent of component three and no more than 50. No, actually, that's the only requirement no less than 40 percent of three. So x three t divided by x one p plus x 2p plus x 3p plus x4 p must be. Greater than or equal to 40 percent? So rearranging this, it will give you the inequality minus point four x one p minus 0.4 x 2p plus 0.6 x three p minus 0.4 x 4p must be greater than or equal to zero, and that's the requirement on the premium grade. They finally the requirement on the diesel. Finally, the requirement on the diesel is that the ratio between component one and the diesel compared to the rest of the component 1L to fall. [00:18:37:05] Must be less than or equal to 0.5. And that will result the following inequality minus 4.5 x one L plus 0.5 x two l minus 0.5 x three l minus 0.5 x 4x4 l. X four L is less than or equal to zero, and that's the first requirement on the on the gasoline, on the diesel and the last requirement on the diesel is. Because you can use the same page. X one l, the last requirement is that no less than 10 percent to one so x one l. X one l by the total amount of components into the diesel must be greater than or equal to zero point one, I think you got the point here. The equation will be zero point nine x one L minus 0.1 x two l minus 0.1 x three l minus 0.1 x four l must be greater than or equal to. Zero. And do verify this yourself to make sure that you know how to get to this result. And that's the last requirement on the the diesel and finally, all components Exige must be greater than or equal to zero for all I where I is, the component goes from one to four and is the grade that goes from one to three. Or it can take the values of regular premium or diesel. To model now, this would excel. I will define my decision variables here, and each cell of these represent represents the amount of a certain component into a certain grade. [00:21:16:28] So, for instance, this cell would represent the amount of component one that goes into the regular grid and this one, the amount of component one into the premium and this one into the diesel and so on for all four components. So these are my decision variables. The sum or across the road here would represent how much I'm using from component one and in solver, I would need to enforce that. This amount cannot exceed the 5000, as we will see in a minute. Now the total amount of a grid. So if I sum up now across column the regular column, it will give me how much I'm producing of the regular grid, how much I'm producing of the regular of the premium grade and the diesel. And I will also enforce an end solver that these amounts must at least be greater than or equal to this role right here. Well, this is my objective function. But before we get into the objective function, I want to show you how we entered the the coefficients of the objective function. If you recall when we developed the objective function, so going back to the beginning of the problem, we actually reduced this revenue minus cost terms to the net profit, which are reflected by these three, these three lines right here. [00:22:48:17] And so as you will see, there is a coefficient for x one r another coefficient for X to answer on a coefficient for X1, P four, two P and so on. And the same thing for this. So these coefficients are entered. And this range, so if we, for instance, if I take the the first equation right here, three x one R plus five x two R and so on. This is reflected in the Excel spreadsheet. Three five zero six. These are the coefficients. So in the objective function, if I take the sum product of these two ranges, the range with the yellow cells and this range of of just blanks, not blank, but white cells, that gives me the objective function. So the coefficient three by x one R plus five by X to R and so on for the regular, then plus the A nine by X1 P plus 11 by x 2p and so on. That will give me my objective function. So this is the profit I'm trying to maximize. And now to get into the constraints. Let me start by actually jumping into the requirements constraints that basically the ratios are so a requirement is a corresponds like a regular requirement for the regular requirement for the regular grade. It's basically based on these lines that you see here. So this is one requirement. This is a second requirement, this is a third requirement. [00:24:34:17] So I have three requirements for the regular. I have one requirement for premium and have two requirements for these. So in this range of. Sells what I have is the different requirements for regular, for instance, if you see the if you recall in the requirement. Let me jump to that constraint over here. The requirement for the regular. The first requirement is the point six x one R minus 0.4 x two are and so on. So this these set of coefficients the zero point six minus 0.4 minus 0.4. These are the coefficients of that equation in this cell. I will take the sum product of these coefficients multiplied by the corresponding exigé variables for R for the regular in this case. And the second requirement on the regular is down here where I take the coefficients of the second equation. So going back to the second requirement on the regular X to R, the ratio must be less than or equal to zero point two. We ended up with this equation. So the coefficients of minus point two point eight minus 0.2 and minus 0.2. They are actually listed in this range of cells. So this cell takes the sum product of these coefficients multiplied by the exigé for the regular, the X1 R, X2, R x three artists for us. So these are the requirements the three requirements for the the regular grade for the premium. [00:26:10:04] I have only one requirement. I inserted here a note that tells you that this must be greater than or equal to zero. This must be less than or equal to zero. This must be a greater than or equal to zero for the premium. It has only one requirement the coefficients of minus 0.4 minus point four point six and points 0.4. If we go to the premium requirement minus 0.4, minus point 4.6 and minus 0.4 are in this range of cells. So this cell, the pink cell, it actually represents the multiplication, the sum product of the coefficients by the X. I p. X one x two x three x four p. And finally, the diesel the same concept. You can take a look at the equations for the diesel and match them with these with these ranges of coefficients. Now. They so these represent here the refuse, the requirements and the issues, the ratio requirements. So this is one set of constraints. Now let's go back to the the the first set of constraints, which is the demand constraint. As I mentioned earlier, that in solver, we need to make sure that the total amount of each grade, so this represents the sum of the regular must be greater than or equal to this number, which is 3000 and the same thing for premium and for these. So this range of cell must be greater than or equal to this range of cells. [00:27:46:22] The the second set of constraints are the maximum availability and this is reflected on top right here. So if I sum up across the each component, the amount available, the maximum amount available for each component is given here. So for this range of cells must be greater less than or equal to the available amounts over here. And and as I mentioned earlier, the ratios, constraints and the requirements are reflected in this in these cells, and you can take a look at the at the equations and the solver. My objective function is to maximize the as the objective function here in green, and these are my decision variables and the constraints are that this range of cells must be greater than or equal to. This range of cells. And all of the these constraints, all of these constraints greater than or equal to zero less than or equal to zero, this represents the requirements. So they actually, if taken as an example, one of these so let's say requirement on the regular grade must be greater than or equal to zero. And the same thing for the rest of the requirements, and finally, the the availability is that this range of sales must be less than or equal to this range of sales, the maximum available for each component. And I just make sure that this is selected so that exigé will be greater than or equal to zero. [00:29:32:04] And that option's there is really no changes here. And I don't have integers or any of that. So I keep it as it is. And when you hit solve, the solution that you see is actually the optimal solution solver found that optimal solution. And this is so this represents for me how much of component one goes into regular, how much of component one goes into premium, how much of component one goes into diesel right here, the three different cells and so on for the rest of the components. And this represents how much I'm producing from the regular, how much I am producing from premium and how much I am producing from diesel. The amount that you see over here is how much I'm using from component one, how much I'm using from component to how much I'm using from component three and component four. And this is my objective function. 71 400 is my optimal solution. It's always a good habit to take a look at your constraints to make sure nothing is violated. Although when solver gives you a that's an optimal solution has been found, it means that all constraints have been satisfied. But it's a good habit to take a look at your numbers to make sure that they are meaningful, that nothing is strange in in your Excel sheet and the numbers make sense to you. And that would be now my optimal solution for this problem.",4412,"[ 0.01093159  0.00265433 -0.00847198 ... -0.00328802 -0.01064464

Data Envelopment Analysis,5.1,DEA,"Title: Data Envelopment Analysis; Description: Data Envelopment Analysis; Transcript: [00:00:01:14] Let's now cover the data and development analysis method data and development analysis, or the EEA, is a technique that utilizes linear programming to evaluate the relative efficiency of organizations that are similar in nature, such as banks, police stations, hospitals, schools, prisons or even government entities like army comparing army to navy to Air Force and so on. These organizations are known are referred to as decision making units, units or organizations that they make certain decisions. And based on these decisions of utilizing inputs, they get certain outputs. And in this method, actually unlike the typical linear programming applications, it's not used for planning purposes. It's rather use to look back at the outcome of certain decisions within the organizations and decide which organization was the most efficient, which are the efficient organizations, which are the inefficient organizations, and by how much there is a room for improvement for those that have been identified as inefficient. So it's a more of an ex-post analysis tool. That's utilized after decisions has been made and and and you have your input and output in general, productivity can be measured by calculating the ratio between the outputs to the inputs. If I have more than one input and output, so in case of, let's say, in a manufacturing system, if you are producing one product and you have the number of units that you produce that your output and your input can be your raw material, you take the ratio between the number of units produced and the input, and that will give you how productive you were. [00:02:07:26] And you can compare different or similar production lines that produce similar products. You can compare the productivity of these lines if you have more than one input and output, such as not only material, but you also have labor. Let's say, then you can. Take the. Weighted sum of outputs and divide that by the weighted sum of inputs with the weights, they reflect the importance of the outputs and the inputs. The difficulty with using the productivity as a measure of comparison is that usually you will get some numbers that they are not very meaningful in a systematic way, they are meaningful in their own way. But for us, it's difficult to look at these numbers and make a judgment about the productivity. So this is why we have the tendency to calculate the efficiency, which is the number between zero and one. That's based on the productivity where we normalized the productivity, and we do that by picking the highest productivity as your reference and then divide all of the other productivity of the other similar processes or organizations, divide them by the best productivity. And that will give you a number between zero and one where the best productivity would be one and the other ones will be either one or less. But it's a number between zero and one, so we can say this process or this organization is 80 percent compared to to the best one, and this is 95 percent compared to the best one and so on. [00:03:58:11] However, when we compare the efficiency of the different decision making units. It may not be easy to come up with these weights that they reflect the importance of the inputs and the outputs. So in some organization, the importance of certain output may be viewed differently than the importance of the same output metric in some other organization, and the same thing applies for the inputs. So it it's not very straightforward to be able to make that comparison among efficiencies of the organizations or the EMU's because of that issue of the weights and and because of the issue of having the organizations to agree on what is the most important input and output. So the EEA will help us with this issue and we will be able to compare the efficiency of different units. Let's take an example to explain how this method works. Suppose that you have four, you have five bank branches and they offer similar or the same services. Use the identical mix of resources. So what we have is. Five branches. They have the same level of expense, and this is just for simplicity at this point. This can be different, but for now, let's assume that they are. They have the same level of expense where everything is in millions. So this branch has an expense over a certain period of time is 100 million and the outputs of these branches are the loans and the deposits. [00:05:45:11] Where branch one, for instance, in the over over a certain period of time, had 10 millions in loans and they had 31 millions in deposits, while Branch two had 15 million in loans and 25 million in deposits and so on. All of them, they spend the same amount. The same budget was spent. Among the same budget for every branch was 100 million. And as I said, this will change. But for simplicity now, let's just keep it the same, and the difference would be just in the outputs in this case. What we are interested in is finding out which branch is the most efficient, utilize the the inputs efficiently compared to other compared to other branches. And in a sense, what we are saying is that which branch was able to maximize the benefit of the inputs and produce the maximum amount of output and compare to compare that to other branches that use the same amount of input, but it couldn't generate the same level of outputs. So in a case like this, if we look at branch to, for instance. It used 100 millions and it generated 15 million of loans of loans and 25 million in deposits. If you look at this branch and compare it to Branch three, you can easily see that for the same level of expense, 400 millions branch to generated 15 million while Branch three in loans, while Branch three generated 20 millions in loans and Branch two generated 25 millions and branches regenerated 30 million. [00:07:51:15] So clearly, Branch three dominates Branch two because it's better to to have more loans and more deposits. So the higher these numbers, the better and the lower the input, the better. So the input is the same. Yet Branch two wasn't able to generate as many loans as many deposits as Branch three. So clearly we can mark Branch two compared to Branch three as being an efficient. But this may not be very clear in all cases, so for instance, if we look at branch for although it generated less loans than branch, say five. It generated more deposits than Branch five. And if you compare four to to three, it generated more loans, but it generated less deposits, so it wasn't. It was easy to see how Branch two is inefficient, but it's not that easy to see how branch for. Is efficient, is inefficient. So in this example. What we would like to see is which ones are the efficient branches so clearly the branches based on this calculation, which we will discuss how it is, it is obtained branches one and three and five. They turned out to be the most efficient branches and branches. Two and four are inefficient. And that efficiency that delta between the 83 and the 100 or the three and the one is the amount of inefficiency, the amount, the room for improvement. [00:09:48:04] To imagine things or to picture how things are calculated, let's start with this diagram where we plot the loans against the deposits. And we actually plot every. Branch's output in terms of loans and deposits on this graph, so. We give this picture, and from this picture, actually, we can see that one, three and five. They have the they they they they form a frontier where they are at the outer edge of that frontier, while 2.4, they are a little bit in the inside area of that frontier. An indication of the efficiency of two and four, as I said, two is clear was clear to look at the data and identify why it is inefficient. But that was not clear in case of five yet. What? What we want to come up with is an identification on which branches are efficient, which ones are not in terms of loans and deposits. And we want to also identify the how much the inefficient ones, how much room for improvement they have. So. The method, basically the approach that the DEA takes is that it says, can you come up with a set of weights for the outputs? In this case, the loans and the deposit show that a branch would be the best among all branches. And if you can find this set of weights, then that branch is efficient. In other words, we leave the decision of the weights to the branch itself. [00:11:57:12] We put the branch in its best light to decide that the loans are not as important as deposits or vice versa, and say, OK, you come up with a weighted value that will beat all other branches if I use the same way. So for instance, if I use the weights three and three arbitrarily and I multiply they, I find the linear combination, the weighted output by multiplying 10 by three plus three, one by three. I will come up with this value for branch, one for branch, two, for Branch three and so on. If I use the set of weights, I have a weighted value that's higher than anyone else for Branch one, so branch one beat everyone else and came out on top. So in this case, I say, OK, Branch one is efficient. I don't judge whether these weights are meaningful or not. I just leave it up to the branch to decide the best set of weights that will give it the best output or the worst weighted output. I apply the same thing for the other branches, so for instance, if I change these weights to 12 and 10 in this case, Branch five will come out on top. And it will be an efficient branch. So. The as long as we can find a set of wait for which the branch achieved the highest weighted value, then that branch can be labeled as efficient. I don't make a judgment about whether this is a meaningful set of weights, as long as you can find this set of weights, branches two and four. [00:13:37:09] They were labelled as an efficient because we could not come up with a set of weights to actually beat everyone else. In other words, no matter how much you try to come up with a set of weights for the loans and for the deposits, any time you multiply these weights by the outputs, for branches to and for loans and deposits for two loans and deposits for four, you always find another branch that will come out higher in terms of the weighted value of the outputs. So we couldn't come up with a set of weights for two and four that will make them higher than the other branches. So in this case, we say that well, branches two and four, they are inefficient because no matter how important you think of these loans and deposits, you're not able to beat the other branches in there in these metrics, and therefore they are considered. And efficient. So it's easy it was easy to see for branch to that it's dominated by Branch three, but it wasn't easy to see. For Branch Foreign, this method will show us how we can actually make this calculation and decide which ones are the most efficient, the efficient ones and which ones are the inefficient ones for units like four four units like Branch four, where it's not very clear. [00:15:06:09] It seems that it got beaten by. One branch in terms of loans, for instance, it got beaten by Branch five, Branch five was able to generate three loans compared three million in loans compared to Branch four and Branch three was able to beat Branch four in terms of deposits. So it's as if Branch four got compared to this hypothetical branch. That doesn't really exist, but it is a combination of branches three and five. Ok, so in other words, Branch three did better in terms of in terms of deposits, Branch five did better in terms of loans and therefore Branch four turned out to be inefficient and in that in that comparison. So we call. We call such a unit that we compare branch for to a hypothetical comparison unit where it doesn't really exist, but it's built from features of other efficient units. Three and five are efficient units, so they have features that they can construct a hypothetical comparison unit and that one, we can compare it. We can fairly use it to compare to other units. The efficient units or the EMU's, the decision making units are referred to as the reference set. So in this problem, since we if I go back to this table where I labeled Branch one, three and five as efficient, these three units are called the reference set for some other branches. So one and three will be the reference set for two and three, and five will be the reference set for four. [00:17:12:07] Branches three and five are considered the reference set for Branch four, because if you noticed here the data, the number of loans for Branch five is higher than that for Branch four and the number of deposits for Branch three is higher four than four than a branch for. So these two dominate the branch four. So some sort of a combination that we represent in a hypothetical branch will have the ability to be more efficient than branch four. And the same thing applies for Branch two, which is dominated in terms of loans by. Branch three. And also in terms of deposits, it's dominated by both Branch three and Branch one. So if I plot these branches on this graph where I have here on the x axis, the loans and on the y axis the deposits and these dots represent the deposits and loans for my different branches branches. Clearly, I can have a frontier here by connecting one, three and five. They will be on the on the edge of this frontier. If I take branch four, for instance. And. Look at the profile of this branch. It basically consists of 23 loans and 23 deposit, 23 millions in loans and 23 millions in deposits. So what we're saying is that there is a hypothetical branch, let's call it for Prime that with the same input, can produce more loans and deposits with the same $100 million input can produce more loans and deposits because branches three and five are able to do it, so Branch four should be able to do it. [00:19:21:00] However, this particular branch hypothetical branch needs to be of the same profile like branch for Branch For has a ratio between deposits to two loans of one 23 to 23. So I want to have a hypothetical branch that may produce maybe 24 to 24 or 25 to 25, 26 to 26. So the same profile, but with the ability to produce more loans and deposits to show you how actually this is done. Let me take the same graph and do some analysis if I take the slope of if I take the slope of this line, the slope of three five. Four, three, five. The slope for three five. Is what? The amount of. Deposits for. Branch three, which is 30 minus 20. Which is the amount for Branch five divided by the amount of the amount of loans for Branch three, which is T minus for that for five, which is three. That gives me a slope of minus one. This slope? Since the hypothetical unit for Prime falls on this line, it's a linear combination of the profile from three and five, so it is it must have the same slope like three five line. So the slope for. Uh, the slope for the branch for prime must be also equal to the same slope of the same slope of three five. [00:21:22:18] Now, I don't know the coordinates for this unit. I'm just trying to find out what's there now, how many loans and how many deposits for four prime I have so that this, this point or this hypothetical branch would actually fall on this line. So since though it has the same slope, then I can calculate the slope for that one and make it equal to minus one. So in other words, so if I take the slope for slope, for, let's say, three and four, prime will be equal fairly. Minus D divided by T minus L, because I don't know these coordinates yet, but since it has the same slope of minus one, I can come up with this equation. So I will have 13 minus D is equal to L minus T, and that is my first equation now since I want to have a hypothetical unit that has similar profile like the original unit branch for then I will take the issue between at Branch four. I have the Raichu, the profile, the profile is. The two deposits, two loans, which is equal to 23 to 23, which is equal to one. In other words, they they must be equal to L whatever deposits I have will be equal to the number of loans. This has become my second equation. If you solve these two equations, solving one and two. That will result the amount of the the value for L and D to be equal to 25. [00:23:18:25] So in other words, my coordinates here are 25 and 25 for this hypothetical branch. Now what this tells me that there is a hypothetical unit or branch that takes its profile or its attributes from branch three and five similar to branch and three and five in terms of its ability to produce these outputs. And I want specifically the one that they have equal loans and deposits because I want it to be similar to number four. And turns out that there is a unit like this that falls on this line with 25 and 25 loans and deposits. I had to use this analysis because I it could have been 26 and 26 or 23 and 24 and 24. We don't know exactly how much that these coordinates should be. So now we know it's 25 and 25, and so. So how much of an improvement? How long is this line over here? I can calculate, since I know that this is. Twenty three, and I know that this is 23 as well. Then I can easily calculate this. Where this would be. The square root of. This would be the square root of 23. Squared plus 23 squared, which will be equal to 32. Point fifty three. And. I also know how long this is. Because now I know these new coordinates, so this length is the square root of 25 and 25 squared. So it will be equal to thirty five point thirty five if I take the. [00:25:28:00] Ratio between. The length of 04 length. To. Zero for Prime will end up being 25. Thirty two point fifty three divided by 35. About 0.35, and that gives me a 92 percent. So what this number tells me now, 0.92, that if Branch four is not at 92 efficiency running at 92 efficiency and it has eight percent more of improvement to be similar to branches three and five, or to a hypothetical unit that consist of branches three and five. So this is how I know how much of an efficiency, how which one is the inefficient branches and how much the efficiency is so that I know by how much more the other branches are beating this branch. Similarly, I can do the same analysis for. For branch to. So for Branch two, if I take if I say that this is. So this is my original branch, and this is the hypothetical two prime hypothetical unit. It it is a branch is one and three. Both are more efficient than two because they beat it in in in the output matrix. So now the slope for the slope for. One three. The slope for one three is 31 minus 30. I recommend that you do this analysis on your own and then compare to what I'm doing, so you can pause at this point and do the analysis yourself. This is one minus minus one over 10. [00:27:27:07] And. I don't know yet the coordinates for two primes, so I have. So the slope for that point is 31. So the slope for. One to prime is fairly one minus. The divided by 10 minus L equals the same slope as our one three. So it's equal minus one over ten, which gives me the equation that L minus 10 L minus 10 is equal to 10. By 31 minus D. So this is one equation. Another equation that I want to know, I want to keep the profile for to the same, so the profile for two is the ratio between deposits to loans, and that ratio is 25 deposits. Two 15 loans. So I want to keep that ratio 15 to 25 to 15 or five to three. I want to keep that the ratio of D to L at this level five to three, which means I have now an equation where D is equal to five over three l. And that's my. Equation two. Solving this equation, these two equations, so solving one and two. Will get me a value for L equal to eighteen point eleven and the equal to 3.2. So in other words, this hypothetical branch over here that has the the coordinates of eighteen point twenty one and three point two. This hypothetical branch is has the same profile like Branch two, which is the ratio between deposits two loans. Yet it has the same level of efficiency like branches one and three, and therefore I know that Branch two should be able given its input, given the amount of expense it has. [00:29:49:21] It should be able to produce a higher level of outputs because the other branches at the same level of input, they are doing it. And how much is that in efficiency? Again, I can calculate this. And compared to this, it turns out if you do the same analysis. It turns out that this is 82 percent. It's 2.8 percent out of the 100 percent, so this is the 100 percent level. So this is an 82 percent. So I know that I have 100 minus 82 point eight amount, which is right here. This this difference of improvement that I can have a branch to do if I do something about it. So there is I. It just gives us an insight into which branches we need to focus on to study and analyze so that they improve their operations. Now. As the number of outputs become lower becomes a larger than two. It's not possible to perform the geographical analysis clearly because I have only two dimensions in this case, we need more of an algebraic approach to help us come up with these numbers and these inefficiencies. In fact, even with two outputs, if I had more than one input, I simplify this to one input only. But if I had more than one input, this analysis wouldn't have been possible because now it is difficult to plot that graph. [00:31:35:20] I just assume that all of them have the same input, while in reality that may not be the case. So we need a we need an algebraic approach to help us conduct. This type of analysis and identify the branches or the decision making units that are efficient versus the ones that are not efficient. To do this analysis and algebraic way, let's utilize linear programming to find for us the optimal weights so that we find out which which units are efficient and which are not given that we will optimize the weights for the inputs and outputs. Let's first define our inputs and outputs and as well as our weights. So Exigé refers to the inputs to our decision making unit case. So if I have certain Branch K X IC will be the inputs to that branch. So if I have multiple inputs. I will have X one K X 2K SDK, et cetera, and the outputs are Wijk. And if I have multiple outputs, it will be y one K y 2K and so on. And if I have a bunch of units, let's say five branches or five units I want to evaluate K will be will go from one to five. Why is the way for the eyes input so the importance of. Certain Input X and UJA is the way for the jth output. So if I have multiple outputs, you will be associated UJA will be associated with each YJ for a specific unit K. [00:33:24:12] So if I take the linear combination of outputs capital y k, it will be the weights multiplied by the output. So y one by y one K plus y two by Y2K and so on. If I have five branches for branch five branches, let's say I will have five terms here and the linear combination of inputs is x k a capital x k, which is represented by the weights multiplied by the inputs for each input. So it will be v one by x one K plus v two by X two K and so on. So let's distinguish between capital X and small. Small X is the a specific input and for a certain unit and a capital, x k is the linear combination of inputs and y small y is the certain outputs for a for a unit K, while capital K is the linear combination of all outputs multiplied by the weights. Now the efficiency as we defined earlier is the linear combination of outputs divided by the linear combinations of inputs. That's my efficiency. If I divide the output by the input will give me the efficiency for the decision making unit under evaluation the AMU zero. So I refer to the unit under evaluation being unit zero. We would like to find the the optimal set of weights that will put that organization or that unit in its best light. [00:34:57:24] In other words, I will tell you go ahead and find the weight, the best values for the input and output weights so that you maximize your efficiency so that you generate the largest efficiency possible. And I will let you decide how much these weights should be to to maximize your own efficiency, and I will use them with the other units. I will use the weights that you come up with for your organization, use them with the other organization and see if other organisation can achieve a better efficiency. So to do so, I will maximize the efficiency, and the efficiency is defined as the ratio between the linear combination of outputs. The linear combination of inputs for that unit under evaluation, where linear and combination of outputs is the weight for the output, the first output multiplied by the output. The first output for that organization. For the one and the evaluation, plus the second output multiplied by the weight for that output and so on, divided by the linear combination of inputs. For that, the IMU under evaluation, I will then need to limit the efficiency to be between zero and one. So I take that ratio between linear combination of outputs to inputs and put a constraint on a constraint on them to limit them to be greater than or equal to zero or less and less than equal to one. And this is for this constraint applies for all units. [00:36:35:21] So I maximize the ratio between the outputs of the inputs for one particular unit. But then I enforce this constraint for all units to be between zero and one, the efficiency between zero and one. And of course, the weights will be not negative. Decision variables this model will play with you and v until the efficiency is maximized. So it will give you an v value so that it maximize the efficiency. But if you notice here in the objective function, I have a ratio between decision variables. So basically this is this model becomes non-linear. Also in the constraint I have ratio between decision variables you and V are the decision variables. So if we decide decision divide decision variables by each other, you end up with a non-linear model. I would like to have a linear model for this problem. So to linear ize it, I will force the linear combination for the unit under evaluation to be equal one. So a capital x four unit zero will force it to be equal to one. By doing this, first of all, I will get rid of this denominator here, so that will be one. So the objective function will be linear as it will become the linear combination of the outputs and the same thing for the constraint. I will linear rise it and that helps us to if I force it with a constraint to be equal to one. That will help us to make this model linear and also to make the the efficiency limited between zero and one is that this does not really this just puts a restriction on the inputs. [00:38:23:24] So this restriction on the inputs make all of them equal to one. And since they are relative to each other, the the the the the relative efficiency between the different units is not going to it's not going to change. So instead of in this case, let's say, before you linear rise it in this case, in this case, if x k was for two terms, let's say I have two terms for two inputs. One was the way it was 10 and the other weight was 100. If I force this x k to be equal to one, it's simply going to just keep the same relationship, but it will force them to be smaller values. Let's say in this case, it will be. Oh, it will be 0.1 to one. So by doing this, it doesn't really affect the output of the the outcome of the model, but it will make the value smaller so that they all add up to one and the inputs for the decision making unit. Notice also that we although we maximize the output for the unit under consideration. So this is the linear combination of outputs for the unit under consideration. We force the linear combination of inputs for that unit to be equal to one. But we have this constraint. We limit the efficiency for this constraint to be between zero and one for all units, including the one under consideration. [00:39:54:22] So you will have five constraints if you have five units to consider in this. So this is a set of constraints for all units. So if you have five of them, you will have five constraints. Over here, you will have only one constraint for the units under consideration, and this one also will be only focused on the unit under consideration when I force the inputs to be equal to one. This, I get rid of this. So basically this becomes this constraint become, of course, it is greater than or equal to zero. Anyway, it's a negative. So the other the other piece of this constraint, it will be. It's as if you have here. Why K divided by one is less than or equal to one by x by x k. Is less than or equal to one, which means that X y y k will be less than or equal to x k, and if you rearrange these terms, you move the X K to the other side that will make this minus x k plus wiki less than or equal to zero. And that's again a linear that's a linear constraint. So this way I linear as the model and I can now run it for every unit, independently, every unit. So I will evaluate Unit one, Unit two, Unit three, Unit four, Unit five, so I will run this model five times. [00:41:27:04] And the efficiency the maximum efficiency that this will accomplish is one. So y zero will be maximum at one. And if you accomplish that efficiency, it means that this unit is efficient. If you maximum, you can find values for Y for you and V that they will not get you a linear combination for the Y for the outputs of one, it means it's an inefficient unit. Notice that we don't really care here for the values of y you and the other than trying to see whether there are certain weights that will help us get to a maximum efficiency of one or maximum output linear combination of the outputs of one. We don't really care how much these values are other than we need the best values to get us the maximum efficiency. So the final model will look something like this, you maximize the outputs of the unit under consideration, the linear combination of outputs subject to the linear combination of inputs is set to one, and you make sure that this constraint for the inputs and outputs is satisfied and you repeat this constraint for all units. So if you have five units this, you will have five constraints represented in this way. And but this one will be only one constraint for unit under consideration, and the objective function will be only for the units under consideration. As Final Notes, A Once you develop the model implemented, a particular DMU is considered efficient. [00:43:03:03] If the performance of the other units does not provide evidence that one of its inputs or outputs could be improved without worsening some of its other inputs or outputs. In other words, it is a unit that will be on the efficient frontier. If you improve one output, another output will become worse and vice versa. So that unit will be considered efficient, something concept like similar to the concept of cost and quality. If you increase the if you know that you have an efficient frontier for cost and quality for a certain process, you cannot increase the quality without increasing the enhance the quality without increasing the cost. So that would that's kind of the idea here or that's the concept here. If so, the DMU is efficient if it's impossible to construct. In other words, a hypothetical unit that does better than that particular unit, and we cannot really push that frontier any further, in other words. Not that when we select the IMU for evaluation, we call it the EMU Zero. But we include this DMU among the set of the emus when we evaluate this set of constraints down here. So in this set of constraints that will include all the emus, including the one under evaluation, however, and this constraint, it will be only the unit under evaluation. And in this constraint, the objective function will be only for the unit under evaluation.",7085,"[-0.01846881 -0.01281899 -0.00966193 ...  0.00156455 -0.01328597

Data Envelopment Analysis Applications,5.2,DEA,"Title: Data Envelopment Analysis Applications; Description: Data Envelopment Analysis Applications; Transcript: [00:00:01:06] Let's now take an application of data and development analysis. This example that was used to demonstrate the method can be now used as an application where we solve the actual problem in which we have five banks or branches of a bank, and they offer similar services and they use identical level of resources. So in this table, the expenses are defined as their inputs, and each branch has the same level of input if everything is in the millions. This would be 100 million dollars in expense for Branch one and 100 million in Branch two and so on to Branch five. The outputs, on the other hand, are the loans and the deposits, and they are they differ from one branch to another. And for branch one, for instance, the number of loans or the amount of loans is 10 million, while the number of amount of deposits 31 million compared to Branch two, which which has 15 million dollar amount for loans and $25 million for deposits and so on for the rest of them. So. We want to find out which ones are more efficient than the other ones and those that are inefficient by how much inefficient are they? So for that, we use linear programming to model the problem and and find them the efficient ones compared to the inefficient ones. And to do so, we define our decision variables and parameters in this case. These are the X and Y are our actual inputs and outputs. [00:01:36:17] So they are not decision variables. They are parameters. In this case where x i k is the I input for the K unit. So X one one would be the first input for the four unit, one x two one would be the second input for unit one and so on, and y GK is the output. So if I have if I have five or if I have three outputs or two outputs in this case, I should have then y one K and Y2K, where K is the unit I am evaluating. Vii and UJA are the decision variables internal to the model, and they represent the weights for the ith input and the output. And the reason these are the decision variables, because these are the ways that we are trying to optimize so that we maximize the output of the linear combination of outputs. So capital y k is the linear combination of outputs. So the first output weight by the output itself for a specific unit, plus the second output multiplied by the out, the weight for the second output multiplied by the output and so on. X Capital X is the linear combination of inputs. The weight for the first input by the first input itself for the first four K unit unit K and the second input for the second the second wait for the second input and so on. So to make it easier to see the model we have the maximized, we want to maximize the linear combination of outputs subject to the the following constraints where x zero is the linear combination of inputs for the unit and the evaluation unit zero. [00:03:33:23] And we force this to be equal to to one, and we want to meet also this constraint. We want to satisfy this constraint. This is the negative linear combination of inputs. Plus the linear combination of outputs must be less than or equal to zero. And of course, the decision variables of the weights must be not negative. There must be greater than or equal to zero specifically for this problem. If I evaluate if I want to have a branch, one evaluated. So I want to maximize the linear combination of outputs for branch one. So I multiply the decision variable that basically the weights for the outputs by the outputs themselves. So 10 and three one. If you recall from this graph, 10 and 31 are the outputs for the first branch. So and here I have 10 and 31 multiplied by the decision variables you want and you U2. The constraints are the linear combination of inputs, and in this case, we have only one input 100 multiplied by the weight. We will be forced to be equal to one. And the rest of the constraints are basically represented by this general constraint. And keep in mind that this is for all the units, including the units and their evaluation. [00:04:48:00] So therefore the first constraint will be the linear combination of inputs negative. The linear combination of inputs, plus the linear combination of outputs for the first unit must be less than or equal to zero. We do it also for the second. Unit, so the linear combination of inputs happened to be identical to the first unit, plus the weights for both metrics, for both outputs, but we have different outputs 15 and 10. So for the second unit 15 and 25, 15 and 25 and for the third one is two and three multiplied by the weights and so on. For all five of them, not how we included the first the as well. So we maximize the output for the unit and the evaluation right here, just the output for that unit and we force its inputs to be equal to one. But we include in this set of constraints for all units this we make sure that this these constraints are satisfied where we have negative linear combination of inputs, plus the linear combination of output to do this and excel. I'll switch to excel. And in this case, we have the data here, the inputs and the two outputs, my decision variables are defined here and initially I do not have anything in there, so they can be zero zero zero. And what you see here is the coefficients for the objective function, which are since we are doing this for the first branch, then they will be 10 and 31, 10 and 31. [00:06:36:08] My objective function is the sum product of the coefficients of the outputs by the outputs themselves and the constraints that I need to satisfy. First is to make sure that the linear combination of inputs for that unit is equal to one. So what you see here is the coefficients for that constraint are basically 100 and zero zero because we have not no, we have only one input. We don't have any other outputs. So that is reflected by the sum product of this range, by the decision variables. So and technically, it is as if our multiplying this cell in particular that has the value of 100 multiplied by v one, which is right here. So if you are to reflect this on the spreadsheet. This will be the one you want, and you too. You won. And you too and the other constraints over here, I'm going to go over just one of them and the rest will be similar. They are the linear combination of negative of the input multiplied by v one, plus the linear combination of the output weights by the output themselves, then by you one and fairly one by you two. Similarly, you have the same formula for the other five constraints. And that would be my constraints now and that I will enforce that the left hand side will be equal to the right hand side and this constraint and it is less than or equal to these to the right hand side on these constraints. [00:08:27:04] So let's go ahead and and remember, we are doing this for branch one. We cannot do them all at the same time. So we have to do it one at a time. And the solver. That would be my objective function that I'm maximizing and maximizing this one. And the decision variables are these and. This cell must be equal to the cell. Over here and the other cells must be less than or equal to the left hand side must be less than or equal to the right hand side. And of course, the decision variables are greater than or equal to zero, so this is this one is checked and under options. I recommend that you check the automatic scaling use, automatic scaling and this option is used whenever you have small numbers to deal with compared to large numbers. And that's the case in the case of the week. It may not make a difference, but and sometimes it may a may. Act strange if you don't have it checked on, you can try both and compare if that's if this is what you want and then when you resolve solve, basically it gives us the optimal values for the input rates and output weeks. And we don't really care for these values that much. [00:09:57:07] They don't necessarily mean much to us. What we really want to look at is the objective function value. As you can see, we got a value of one, which means that this unit is efficient. So what happened here is that we asked the model to come up with a set of weights that will put this branch in its best light. That will give this branch the the the a way to maximize its outputs. And the model came back and says if the wait for the input is only 0.01 and the wait for the first output is ignored for the loans, it's ignored, it's zero and the wait for the second output is 0.03. Then you will end up with a case that has an efficient unit of one. And for our purposes, we consider this case. As an efficient branch, we do so, so now Branch one is efficient, we can copy this sheet and do it for Branch two. So and here I have branch to. I have branch to and this analysis for Branch two, and I did similar things, except now the outputs are for they belong to Branch 215 and 25. So this would be for this. These are the outputs, these are my decision variables. This is my objective function where I multiply the coefficients by the decision variables and and the the input is still the input. The first constraint of zero equal to one is still the same as before, because for this, all of the expenditures are the same for all branches. [00:11:55:27] So basically, it doesn't matter if they were different, then you will see different values here and the rest of the constraints they also. Are they also remain the same, so there is no change in the bottom here simply because I have the same input? So there is there is no change if you are evaluating Branch one or Branch two, and the outputs also remain the same. So. So, for instance, if you take this constraint, is the linear combination of outputs by the weights, plus the linear combination of the input by the weights and when you solve this model again, for now, we are doing it for. So the only difference between this spreadsheet and the first one is the branch we are doing this for. We're using the outputs for branch two and the inputs are the same because they all happen to be the same. So when you solve this, you get an efficiency of eighty two point eight. So now the second branch is not efficient and the amount of inefficiency is about 17 percent. Let's do it together. Let's do it together. The the same exercise for branch branch three in Branch three. I will use the exact same. I will use the exact same sheet. So if I make a copy of this sheet for Branch two and make it create a copy and call it Branch three. [00:13:38:22] So what changes do I need to make here? I'll be I won't be studying this anymore. I'll be so if I highlight the third branch. If I highlight the third branch. And that would be the branch I'm looking at the decision variables, cells. They remain the same. The output for for this branch is now different. It's 20 and 30. Okay. 20 and 30. That's the difference from the branch to. So now we are doing it for Branch three and the input constraint will remain the same because it happened that it happened, that the input is the same for all of them. And if it wasn't, then this constraint would be different and the rest of the constraints will remain the same. This is for the first unit. This is for the second unit and so on. So now in solver. My objective function, everything is the same and no changes if I had solve. I got a one, which means that Branch three is efficient. The same thing for Branch four. It happened to be actually inefficient of 92 percent. That corresponds to the example that we cover. It's a little bit inconvenient to keep copying these, to keep copying these sheets. So there is a slightly simpler, simpler way of doing this. I have a sheet of that's called index, where you use where you use the function in Excel, that's called index. [00:15:34:13] And in this function, the nice thing about this function that it will pull the appropriate data. So the only thing that I change whenever I'm evaluating a different unit, so if I evaluate Unit one, Unit two, I need to get the inputs or the outputs for Unit two and also the input for Unit two. It just happened to be the same input for all cases, but the outputs at least are different. So instead of creating multiple sheets for each one, I can use the index function, and the way it works is that it's as you can see here, it says index. And then you define the range where you're going to look up these values. And then you specify the value that you're looking for. In this case, it's arbitrary, and I fixed it by using the dollar sign. So it won't change when I copy and when I copy the formula over, so I will look for the second unit. So basically the second unit is this role. The data is associated with the second row. And they range, and then I will have to define identify which column I'll be interested in, so I'm trying to pull the loans data. So I specified number of column number two. So this way, when I change the unit from two to one, let's say not how this will change. Now it's pulling the thirty three point three, and if I go back to two, it will pull the 50. [00:17:00:04] The same thing here, except now I change the column number, so it's still interested in. I'm still interested in getting the information for Branch two, but now I want this second third column in this range that I defined. So the fields are the array that you're interested in. Column number and row number and column number is the rest field in this function. So finally, you will get this value for the second branch. You will get the number of deposits. So if I want to do the analysis for Branch three. Note how this will change if we didn't have. Are different inputs. If we didn't have the same input, we have different inputs, we can use the same function. So in this case, I use the index to pull the data for the branch. Three, let's say, because I'm using the number three here and I pull the first column. Index of the so the array is the same. The everything is the same. But now I'm getting the input, which is the first column in this in this array. It happened to be 104. All of them, if they were different, then you will get different numbers. And this way, if I want to evaluate, let's say, number one all over, I need to change is this number I go to solver I had solved. I got an efficiency of one. If I'm doing number two, I had solve. [00:18:31:17] I changed the number two and I had solved, now I get a different number if I change number three. I had sold I get a one. And finally, if I'm doing no, let's say five, OK, let's say five, you have to resolve the model. Number five will get you also one and I missed number four. Number four, although when you change this to number four. Notice how the objective function value changes. But that's not the optimal value because that's based on the weights of the previous branch. So you need to go to solver and solve again, and that will get you the 92 percent. So branches, then by the end, I create a summary. Basically, you copy and paste the value of the solution, and it tells me that branch one, three and five are efficient and the ones are highlighted with with pink. They are the inefficient ones, and the amount of efficiency is 83 percent almost and 92 percent. So you have room for improvement for branches to and. This is how we used excel to. This is how we used excel to come up with the solutions for these different branches, so I have a snapshot for Branch one and Branch two, and I also have a snapshot of a branch for we did Branch three and Olive Branch five for you as an exercise, but we just demonstrated now and this is the summary of all efficiencies.",3521,"[-0.01884361 -0.00622346  0.00518066 ... -0.00286519 -0.02340126

Integer programming and linear programming, they are very similar in the way they look and the way we formulate problems, with the exception that an integer programs, we enforce some constraints on the decision variables to make them integers. And that can be on a set of on the whole set of decision variables. Or it can be on a subset of decision variables that they are required to be integers. We have three types of integer programs. We have the binary integer programs in which the decision variables must be either zero or one. They cannot take any other, any fractional values between zero and one, and they cannot take values greater than one or less than zero. We may have more general integer programs in which the decision variables must be simply integers one, two, three four and so and so on. The third and most general case is when we have mixed integer programs in which some of the decision variables may be integers must be integers, and some others can be continuous. Let's contrast integer programming and linear programming. Although on the surface and the way we formulate them, it looks very similar with the exception that we need to add a constraint on some or all of the decision variables to make them integers, the in the background, the methods that are used and algorithms that they are used to solve. Integer programs are very different from those that are used with linear programs and linear programming. The Simplex algorithm is the most commonly used to solve linear programs in which if you recall and imagine the graphical solution for a simple problem, the Simplex algorithm essentially checks the corners of the feasible region and picks the best corner, and that would be the optimal solution in integer programs. [00:02:10:21] The optimal solution may reside somewhere else. It may not necessarily be on the corners it could be, but in some cases it may be within the feasible region and therefore you need a lot more checking and enumeration to find the optimal solution. The most commonly used algorithm for integer solving integer programs is a branch and bound, although we don't get into the details of the Simplex algorithm or the branch, and then we focus more on modeling. It's important to know that the solution methodology in the background is very different when you have a linear program, an integer program, and you need to know that so that when you formulate an integer program compared to a linear program, you know that it could be. Much more time consuming to solve a linear and integer program than a linear program. Let's demonstrate this with a simple example, if we have this maximization problem where you're maximizing this objective function of x one plus six x two. Subject to these constraints. Where you have a one constraint. X one plus 12 x two is less than or equal to 36 and x one less than or equal to three. When you plot this and it's required that X1 and X to be non-negative and integers when you plot these, if you ignore this for a second, if you ignore the integer requirement for a second, let's plot the constraints. [00:03:48:03] You will give this feasible region when you plot these two constraints. This is the first constraint, and this is the second constraint. And as we learned the optimal solution for the linear program, if we didn't have this condition of integers, it will reside on one of these corners, either here or here or here. This is a maximization problem. So the objective function is this dashed line. And when you solve this problem as a linear program for now, just ignore the red dots that you see. Imagine they don't exist. That would be the solution for the linear program. It will happen to be this corner where the optimal solution. Is X equal to three x one equal to three and X two is equal to 275 with an objective function value of nineteen point five? Now the problem with the solution is that it has a fraction and so far we have sometimes approximated this whenever we have to deal with integers. To round this down because if you rounded up, you are likely in this case for sure. If you round it up to exceed the feasible region and you would go outside of the bounds of your constraints. So if you round it up, you will be infeasible. You will get to this point of three and three. So you end up rounding it down if you want a real integer, if you want for sure, an integer solution, if you round it down to two. [00:05:20:08] You will end up with this solution, which is suboptimal. It's not the optimal solution, because if you actually solve this as an integer program, this is the optimal solution right here. So as you can see, rounding the solution, the LP solution, we call it the LP relaxation because we relax the integer constraint and we find the solution and we just simply round it. That's called the LP relaxation. And clearly, if you do this rounding approach, you will end up with a solution that's suboptimal, you will end up with a solution with this stranded solution, while in reality the optimal solution for the integer program is over here. Now, what makes a an integer program much more difficult and requires a different way of solving the problem or different method of solving the problem, although the formulation the only difference between a linear program and integer program is this simple word that X1 and X2 must be integers, but that will kick off a completely different way of solving the problem in the linear programs. You simply go around the corners and you inspect these corners and you pick the one that gives you the best solution in the integer program. Because the solution doesn't have to be on the corners, it can be anywhere in the feasible region where you see the red dots. The red dots are basically integer solutions, so this is my space, my potential. [00:06:58:06] Optimal solution space, so I may have this could be a possibility, this could be a possibility, this could be a possibility, this could be a possibility. So as you can see, you have significantly more possibilities, which can be optimal. It doesn't have to be the one on the corners or even close to the corners. It can be somewhere in between. So as you can see, you need a lot more checking a lot more enumeration when you treat this problem as an integer program instead of a linear program. And this is why you need much more sophisticated algorithms in the background, and the most commonly commonly used one is the branch and bound. Now let's. So, so so it's important to realize that if you formulate a problem as an integer program, you potentially can be increasing the solution time exponentially. You can be increasing the amount that requires a computer to find the solution significantly from if you treat it as a linear program. This is why if you can live with the linear program and you don't necessarily require integer solutions in especially for large problems, it is highly recommended that you formulate it as a linear program, not as an integer program, but in many cases you don't have a choice because you need to have integer values. And some of these integer values, especially if you have a binary integer programs, they may mean something logical, not necessarily something physical. Well, by this I mean, there's values of zero and one. [00:08:30:04] They don't necessarily represent amounts of things that you want to produce. They can represent assignments or they can represent allocation, or they can represent something logical that you're trying to accomplish and not something physical like a product. So. Going to excel to show you to demonstrate how you solve a problem as an integer program versus a linear program. This is a snapshot of an example, the same example we used. If I go over it with excel over here, this is the problem that I just showed on the slide where you have the X1 and X2, these are the coefficients of the objective function. These are the decision variables, which we start with zero and zero. We don't know the actual values of them. My objective function is the sum product of the coefficients by the decision variables, and my constraints are here where the sum product of the one x one plus 12 x two that's calculated by the sum product function must be less than or equal to 36. And the second constraint is one x one, and there is nothing for X2, which is zero. But some product of these must be less than or equal to three when I go to solver. And I select my objective function, maximize decision variables are here, and I enforce the constraint that this left hand side of the constraint less than or equal to the right hand side. Ok, and I solve none negativity constraint for X1 and X2 and make sure that you select the Simplex LP because this is a linear problem. [00:10:18:07] And when I hit Solve. I get an optimal solution from Solver, which is basically three and 275, as we demonstrated in the graph with the objective function value z of nineteen point five. If I solve this as an integer program, what I have extra what I have in addition to the previous formulation in solver, I basically add this decision, this constraint where I say these decision variables must be integers and the choice of an integer. It is listed down here in the in the in the dropdown menu. Note that you also can make them binary. You have the choice of make them just integers or or binary. This option of def it means that different than and these are common and permutation problems. Now we mostly will be using these two options when it comes to integer programming. So in this case, I want to require X1 and X2 to be integers. So I selected integers and I had. Ok. And that added this constraint, everything else remained the same in options. Make sure that you don't have this. Checkbox on so you don't want to ignore integer constraints, you want the integer constraints. If you say ignore integer constraints, it will treat it as a linear program, not as an integer program. So just make sure that this is not checked and the automatic scaling, sometimes it helps solver to find the solutions without too much trouble. So if I hit OK and I had solve, solver will find a solution, an integer solution to the problem. [00:12:03:28] If I keep the solution and the the the decision variable values are zero and three, as I demonstrated in the graph and the objective function values 18. So notice that with integer programs, the objective function value was less than the linear program. So this is why the integer program can never be it an objective function value can never be the linear program because if you go back to the previous chart where the the, there is no way for the integer solution to be outside of the feasible region. And the farthest point on the feasible region is the LP solution, so an integer solution cannot be higher. So it's not you're not going to get a higher value because it cannot go outside of the feasible region it must be within. So the best case scenario that the IP and the LP will have the same solution, and in many cases, the IP will have less objective function value or a worse objective function value. In this case, it was 18 compared to nineteen to nineteen point five. So the the point that I want to emphasize here is that integer programs are much more difficult in formulation. They are very similar. But in in solving the problem, they are much more difficult because you have a lot more points for the algorithm to evaluate when it comes to integer programs compared to just evaluating the corners for the using the simplex.

We will also explore various methods for solving integer programming problems such as branch and bound, cutting planes, and branch andOptimization Integer programming Decision variables Objective function Constraints; Transcript: [00:00:01:29] Let's go over an application of integer programming known as the capital budgeting problem. And this application, basically, we need to select a set of projects from a portfolio of projects, and we want to maximize the value of the of all projects without exceeding the allocated budget. So when we say we want to maximize the value, the value can be in terms of expected profit or the net present worth of these projects or maximizing the usage or anything that we are interested in maximizing. Subject to constraints of not exceeding their budget and possibly not exceeding some other resources. This problem can be modeled as a binary integer program. So let's take an example of this problem, suppose that we have a for possible facilities that we want to select from to build, and each facility has a certain number of people per day that can use it. So, for instance, a swimming pool can be used expected to be used by 300 people. Tennis center by 90 people. And so on. The cost of each product project is given to us and how much space or acres it needs is also given to us. So the objective is to pick the ones that will maximize the usage of total usage of facilities. And of course, we have a certain budget which is in this case, 120000 that we cannot exceed, and we also have a limited amount of land to build on. And this we cannot exceed a total of 12 acres to formulate this as an integer program. [00:02:03:06] First, let me define my decision variables x one through X4 to represent one if a swimming pool is constructed and zero if it's not X two is equal to one if a tennis court is constructed and zero if it's not and so on for the athletic field and the gym. If these are my decision variables, which are, by the way, you're going to have to be binary decision variables either zero or one. I want to maximize my total usage, so my objective function will be the 300 people per day multiplied by whether I select this project or not. If it is one, then 300 people will be included in the objective and if it is not selected, meaning it's zero this term will drop from the objective, plus 90 people by whether I select the second project, 400 by the third project and so on. The constraint is. To limit myself to $120000 in budget. The first project will cost $35000 if I multiply this by a binary variable of either zero or one. And if this project is selected, then I already consumed $35000 for this particular project. If it's not selected, then I'm not using anything. That term will be zero 10000 for the second one, 25000 for the third one and 90000 for the fourth one. All of the costs, the total amount of cost will be must be less than or equal to 120000. [00:03:36:11] The second requirement is not to exceed 12 acres of land and to model this, I basically multiply the usage of land or the the how much land a certain project will will take four by x one. And if its project is selected, this means I will consume four acres out of the 12 plus to buy the second facility type plus seven and three by the third and fourth types. Of course, not to forget that our decision variables are binary either zero or one. And a problem like this, in some cases, you may have some additional constraints, it doesn't have to be just caused. It may have some other types of resources that we cannot exceed, but the principle is the same. Let me now take the that formulation and implemented in Excel and Excel. I have my four projects, there's the the swimming pool, tennis center, athletic field and gymnasium. I I have my usage parameter, which is given to me. I also have the cost for each project. I have the acreage for each project. So these are all parameters that are given to me. They are deterministic. They are known beforehand. The cells here are the decision variables. And right now I'm starting with zero zero zero zero, meaning I'm not selecting any project if I select. If if a project is selected, then it will turn to a one like this. And as you can see, the objective function will turn to 300. [00:05:18:07] If I select the second one, it will add 90. So the total budget, the total objective function will be 90 to see how the constraints are formulated. If you look at the cost, the cost is the sum product of the cost per project multiplied by the decision variable the set of decision variables, so it will take the 35000 multiplied by this cell, plus the 10000 by the cell and so on. So by the end, it will give me how much usage? How much how much cost is I used? How much I used out of my budget and here the same principle, but it's applied to the acreage, how many acres are used. So that will multiply will be the sum product of the acres multiplied by the decision. Variables must be less than or equal to the amount given to me, which is the 220000 and the 12 acres. The objective function is the sum product of the decision variables by the amount of people the daily usage of of the facilities represented by how many people are expected to use each facility. This is the model right here so that you can see what everything in the formulation, how everything in the formulation is implemented in solver. Insolvent, I will maximize my usage or my decision variable. My objective function sell right here. And decision variables are given to me here. I selected here the the yellows and the yellow sails. These are all binaries. So I include this as a constraint. [00:07:03:05] So I add a constraint where I select these cells and set them to be binary. Remember and solver, you can set this binary option in the dropdown menu. And lastly, the the usage of my resources, the dollars or the the ACR's must be less than or equal to the maximum amount allowed by the problem, which is 100 2012 acres when I sold so as a starting point. If I start with zero and zero. And then go to solver. Before I had solve, it's a good idea to always check two things first, make sure that unconstrained variables are not negative, although in this case you don't really need this option because you only have binary variables if you had binary variables and some other continuous variables. Then in this case or integers, in this case, you need to check this on, but it doesn't hurt to keep this option checked on. It doesn't give you any errors or anything. It's a good habit and there are options. It's it's important that you take a look at the solver options and make sure that this option, ignore integer constraint, is not selected. If you select it, then it may. The solver may end up giving you fractional values for the binary variables, which is not what we really want. So the options are set right and if I had solve. It's always good to look at the message that silver gives me all constraints and optimality conditions are satisfied, and I want to keep this solution. [00:08:38:15] So the solution is the optimal solution is to build the swimming pool and the athletic field. That is what's going to maximize my usage up to 700 people. If you look at the amount I used out of my budget, I used $60000 out of the 120000 and I used 11 acres out of the 12. So I have 6000 60000 left. So I have a lot of money left, but I'm now constrained, more constrained by the acres. And and even though I may have a little money left to do another project, for instance, the athletic field, which is only 25000, I have already 60, I can use that. However, the acres are seven and that will exceed the 12 the maximum of 12 acres. That would be the solution for this problem. If I have additional constraints, I simply list them here and include them in solver. So that's a snapshot of my solution, so this is known as the capital budgeting problem, it has a lot of real life applications. And but that's the most kind of the simplest form of it. Let's now take a look at some of the additional constraints. That we may actually encounter in reality. For instance, you may have mutually exclusive constraints, meaning if you do one project, you cannot do the other one and vice versa. So what if you can build either the tennis court or the swimming pool, but not both? Ok. [00:10:23:05] Keep in mind to keep the modern linear. You cannot use f statements in your integer program integer programming, linear programming. They don't allow for statements like computer programming, so we really have to figure out ways to go around the use of F statements, and that can be accomplished by adding a constraint that says X one plus x two. Must be less than or equal to one. Why does this constraint serve us as a as a logical constraint to limit the bill, the building of both facilities? The options I have or the possibilities I have for the for this, for this constraint is that either X one will be zero and X two will be zero x one will be X one will be one x two will be one x one will be one or an x two zero and or zero and one. So let me let me go through these possibilities here really quick. If I have x 1+ x two. X one plus x two must be less than or equal to one. What are my possibilities? I can either have both of them want one and one. All possibilities are one and one zero and one one and zero and zero and zero. The condition says if you build. A tennis center, you cannot build the swimming pool, and if you build a swimming pool, you cannot build a tennis center. So this constraint, how does this constraint help us to model this condition? If, if? If I build. [00:12:23:26] Both of them. If I build both of them, it means this condition will exist and this condition is violation of the constraint because one and one is equal to two. That's not less than or equal to one, so that constraint will be violated. The rest of the conditions are OK because I can either build the swimming pool but not build the the the. Tennis center, or I can build the tennis center, but not the swimming pool or I can build neither. And that's acceptable because that condition says if you build one, you cannot build the other one. Nothing in there that says you have to build one of them. Ok, so in this case, the only condition that we don't want to happen is this condition. Ok, I don't want this condition to take place, and this constraint will ensure that. This condition, the first condition of one, does not happen because if solver decides to set X one and X to equal to one each one of them to be equal to one, it will violate the constraint. The job of the constraint is to prevent this condition from happening, and this is why that constraint can be modeled in this way. Ok, so what if the condition is the. If you build a if you if you what if you must build one of the two? Either the tennis centre or the gym? Ok. [00:14:05:18] Meaning either you build X2 or X4 either, but you have to build one of them. This constraint X2 plus X4 serves to ensure that this will take place going back to our notepad. If I have such a condition, basically I must build either the the swimming pool or the gym. Ok, this is my condition to to build must build the tennis center or the gym. This constraint of x one. Plus extra equals to one. Let's see what. What are the possibilities I can have one and one, I can have zero and one, I have one and zero and I have zero and zero. The the condition that we don't want to happen are actually two conditions. We don't want this to happen and we don't want this to happen because we have to build one of them. So if I build this one, if I build this one, then I don't build the first the the swimming pool. If I build the gym, I don't build the swimming pool. And if I build a swimming pool, I don't build the gym. I don't want a case where I build both of them, and I don't want a case that I build. I build none of them. And by the way, this is two and four, not one and two. So it can be, you know, the condition could have been applied to this one, to this, to this constraint, if the condition was tennis center or swimming pool, the same, the same principle. [00:15:43:10] But here as just another example, we said X2 plus X4 must be equal to one, meaning the swimming pool or the the gym. So this constraint, this condition is not going to happen because otherwise it will violate the constraint. It will be equal to two, not one. And this is not going to happen because it will be equal to zero, not one. So this constraint will help us to model a case where you have multiple choice constraints. What if you have another example where another condition where it says what if exactly two out of four facilities must be built? In other words, we don't really care which ones you build as long as you build maximum of two again, an integer programming, you don't really do maximum and minimum in the constraints you have to linear ize it. You have to make it just a linear equation or inequality. So if I have to build maximum two out of four, and given that all of these decision variables are binary, they are not going to take other than zero or one. If I add all of them up and set them to equal to two, then this constraint will guarantee that only two of these terms will be equal to the value of one for each one of them, and the others will have to be zero on zero. So I may build swimming a swimming pool, a swimming pool and tennis center and not build the gym, and that the the field and the gym and so on. [00:17:12:26] So this constraint gives us also another, you know, another way of potentially seeing some of these constraints in reality, where you are limited to just two facilities. Now, another possibility is conditional constraints in conditional constraints, where building one facility will be dependent on building another one. So, for instance, if the tennis center cannot be built unless the swimming pool is built. So now we have a condition, if I want the swimming pool is. The swimming pool is XT2 and the tennis center is X-1. So what this condition says that if you want the tennis centre to be built. Then you have to build the swimming pool, a tennis center cannot be built unless the swimming pool is built in, this kind of constraints, we really have to be careful not to rush into formulating such constraints because they can be a little bit tricky. We have to exhaust all the possibilities to make sure that our constraint is correct. So we'll we'll take a look now on how to formulate a constraint like. In this case, if I. Have a swimming pool is a precondition for the for the tennis centre, then x one, the conditioner that I really want to achieve is if I have X1 and X2, I don't know yet the relationship between them. But the condition says if the tennis court cannot be built unless swimming pool is built, so what are the possibility? It can be one and one zero and one one and zero and zero and zero. [00:19:05:27] So what we're saying, remember that this is the swimming. And this is tennis. Ok, so what we're saying is that at the the the swimming pool is a precondition. So X1 is a precondition for X2. Can we have both of them built? Yeah, because the tennis centre, if it needs to be built, the swimming pool must be built so both of them can be built. How about if I build the swimming centre, the swimming pool, but I don't build the I don't build the swimming. I the I don't build the swimming pool, but I built the tennis center, meaning this this second condition, is that a possibility? Well, to build the swimming pool, I have to build the tennis. I have to build that. The tennis center cannot be built unless the swimming pool is built, so. I can't have this a value of one. Over here without having this value over here of one, so this condition is not acceptable. How about the other conditions? Can I build the swimming pool and not build the tennis center? Yeah, because the the the the statement says the condition, the precondition is on the tennis center. The swimming pool must be built first. Then you build the tennis. So but there is nothing in there that says if you build the swimming pool, you have to build the the tennis. [00:20:43:15] You can build a swimming pool and not build the tennis center, but not the other way around. So this this condition is also acceptable. And not building either one of them is also acceptable. So there is no nothing against that. So what would be a constraint, what would be a relationship between X1 and X2 that will allow the first, the first, third and fourth possibilities to happen, but not the second one, which is the one in red here? If you you can pause for a second and think about the relationship between X1 and two before you see the answer. So in this case, if I have a relationship where it says X, one must be greater than or equal to X two. What is going to happen? This means that always this first field, this first value over here will have to be greater than the second value. So in this case, a greater than or equal to in this case, it will be OK. In this case, it will be OK greater than or equal. In this case it is equal, but in the second case, it is not. It is not equal. It is not greater than or equal. So that constraint will enforce this condition. To put it in a standard format, I always put the decision variables on the left hand side. So that will be a constraint like this. Okay. How about this last constraint before we switch to excel and see how we implement these constraints? The last constraint says if the swimming pool is constructed, then the tennis centre must be constructed and vice versa. [00:22:20:04] If the tennis centre is constructed, the swimming pool must be constructed. So either if you do one, you have to do the other, you cannot do one or the other. So in this case? In this case, if I have X one and X two, I can build both both of them. How about I build one, but not the other one? This one is OK, but this one is not OK. How about so this one is not OK? How about this one? Not OK because I'm building one, but not the other one? How about not building either one? It's OK. So if I don't construct a construct either one, it's fine. So I want a condition. I want a relationship between X and one and X two that will guarantee that the first and the fourth can happen, but not the second and third possibilities. What would I do in this case again? I recommend that you pose at this point and try to think about it for a second before we before you see the answer. In this case, if I set the relationship simply to be equal to each other, if one is equal to one, then the second one will be one. If one is equal to zero, then the second one will be equal to zero. [00:23:42:13] So to put it in a standard format, I will take the difference between them and set it equal to zero. So if both are one, the difference is zero. If both are zero, the difference is zero, so that constraint will take care of it. The second and third condition will never happen because of this, because of this constraint. Let's now switch over to excel to show you how you actually can simply implement these qualitative type of constraints. So this sheet and this file, you see the original the original case without any qualitative constraints in this one. It has the first qualitative constraint that we discussed, which is. Oh, which is the tennis in this constraint, the tennis and the swimming pool. The tennis and the tennis centre cannot be built unless the swimming pool is built, which is X1 plus X2 is less than or equal is less than or equal to its less than or equal to one. In fact, I meant to say that this is the first condition of mutually exclusive constraint, where X1 plus X2 plus one is X1 plus X2 is less than or equal to one, which is which could respond to this condition here. It corresponds to this condition right here. And you can easily change. I don't have the implementation for this following one, but it is just similar to this one. So it is the implementation for these two. For the multiple choice case, it's very easy. [00:25:18:14] You can implement it by just selecting X2 and X4 to be equal to one. And here you sum all of them up and you make them equal to two. To see the conditional constraints were the first one. The tennis center cannot be built unless the swimming pool is built. That basically. That's basically is in this condition here where you set the. In fact, this condition over here is the only one that's not implemented in the Excel spreadsheet, but the rest of them are implemented. And switching over to the Excel spreadsheet, I'll show you how we included these constraints in this case. And in the case of the preconditions I took, the difference of x one minus X2 must be greater than or equal to zero, and I plug it in here. So these cells, they show the difference between X one and X two. And in solver, I said that this value must be greater than this value that you see active over here or this cell that you see actively over here. And when you solve this problem, you end up with the same solution of 700 people, but it also satisfies it makes sure that the condition is satisfied. Keep in mind that keep in mind that what if that optimal solution happened to be, let's say, zero and one? So the first one is zero, and this one is one. Notice that this doesn't this violates the constraint, so this condition will never happen. [00:26:59:03] This condition will never happen because minus one is not greater than or equal to zero. So even if you start with this and you solve the gain, you will have the same optimal solution of 700 people. And the last, very last condition where we said if the swimming pool is constructed in the tennis center must be constructed and vice versa. It's implemented in this sheet where x one is equal to X two or the difference between them is equal to zero. So that is the. That's the condition where the difference between them is equal to zero and insolvent. I will set the cell, the cell must be equal to the cell and the solution to this will give me a 550. So not to say that X1 and X2 happen to be zero and zero. Can I have this condition like this? No, because otherwise this constraint will be violated. Can I have this condition like this? No, because this constraint is violated so I can have either one and one. So that's OK. However, I am violating some other constraints. So I need to know if these were two zeros, then it's OK, but that's again, not the optimal solution. 390. So the optimal solution is what Solver gave us, which is the 550 where you don't construct either one of them. And that's acceptable from a constraint perspective. Constructing both of them are acceptable. However, the other constraints will become binding and you violate the you violate some other conditions.",5363,"[ 0.01532683 -0.0021912   0.00494297 ... -0.00165288 -0.01218101

In this module, we will explore the uses of Integer Programming in the context of the classic Set Covering problem. We will look at how Integer Programming can be used to find the optimal solution for a Set Covering problem, and how it can be used to optimize the solution. We\'ll also discuss various algorithms and techniques for solving the Set Covering problem. We\'ll wrap up the module by discussing the implications of Integer Programming for SetOptimization Integer programming Set covering problem Decision variables Objective function; Transcript: [00:00:01:28] Let's now take another application of integer programming known as the knapsack problem. And this problem, we have to select a set of items from any items and place them in a knapsack such that we maximize the benefit or the utility of items without exceeding the weight or the size of the knapsack. So you can think of situations where say that a hurricane is coming and you need to pick the most valuable items and stick them in your car. And that's the only space that you have. So the car becomes your knapsack or the space available for items is your knapsack. So you would want to pick the items that are most valuable to you, such that they don't exceed the size of the trunk of your car. So in this case, to formulate a an integer program for this problem, if x I if I is a binary variable of zero or one for all items. So it's either an item is selected or not selected and there is an associated value for each item. It can be a profit, it can be utility, it can be whatever value C for each item. So C one is the value for item one multiplied by X one of zero or one, which is if I if I select item one or not, C two is the value for the second item and whether it's selected or not and so on. [00:01:40:18] So I want to maximize the total amount of value, but I cannot exceed the size of my knapsack. B So B is the size of my trunk. Let's say they my car trunk, and I cannot exceed that size. Each item will take a certain amount of space or there is a cost associated with each item A. So item one, if it is selected, it will cost you a one item, two, it will cost you a two and so on. So the total amount of cost or the total amount of volume or the total amount of space, the total amount of weight must be less than or equal to the knapsack size. So this is the formulation for the knapsack problem, if you recall the capital budgeting problem, it's a it's an application of of this problem. So in to take an example, consider a company that is that can invest in R&D projects one through eight and the total budget cannot exceed 300000. So my items are the projects one through eight. The cost of each project is given to me. So that's my a one, a two or three until eight eight and the profit for each profit or the expected profit or the net present value for the for the project is 360000 for the first one 824. The second one and so on. So that's my profit. If I select the corresponding project, I cannot exceed a budget of 300000. [00:03:20:01] The formulation, the mathematical formulation, you can easily construct that and it's similar to this formulation. I will show you this and excel directly. You can write the formulation on your own in this project. I have the eight projects here. I have my decision variables. I have my decision variables right to you and. And the the. The cost of each project is given here, and the profit for each project is given here. The objective is to maximize the total profit, so it will be the sum product of the decision variables multiplied by the profit. So initially I can start with zero for all of them. I don't know the answer yet. So my profit is really zero. And I cannot exceed the total amount of 300000, so the usage is the same product of the selection of X, I multiplied by the cost or the expense of each project and software. I want to maximize my total profit, which is this cell right here. These are my decision variables as usual. And these are binary decision variables. Make sure that you select binary from this dropdown menu. And finally, I have the the the total cost of the selected projects must be less than or equal to the available funding for these projects. Very similar to the capital budgeting problem. So again, and and under options, make sure that the this option is not selected because otherwise you get fractional values. [00:05:12:20] Everything else can remain the same. And when I had sold I, it gave me an optimal. This is the optimal solution, and it selected Project two, five and six, and this would be my optimal solution. Now, so this would be the. The optimal solution for my my simple example, then the knapsack problem was extended to something known as the multidimensional knapsack problem and the multidimensional knapsack problem. Basically, it's instead of having one knapsack, you're going to have a knapsack, so you have B1 through B.M. as the capacity of the different knapsacks. The cost for the profit for selecting an item is still the same as defined in the knapsack problem. So the multidimensional or knapsack problem is the same because the difference is in the constraints, it's not in the objective. So the cost is per item selected as ECJ age is the cost of assigning Item J to a knapsack. I So now I have two dimensions for the problem where the cost may be in terms of assigning a certain item to a certain knapsack will have a different cost than assigning the same item to a different to a different knapsack. Now, keep in mind, the problem is not to decide which item to assign to which knapsack the problem is to. If I select a certain item, it may have, let's say, a certain volume and a certain weight. [00:06:54:03] So you don't want to exceed the volume and you don't want to exceed the maximum weight for the the knapsacks. If I have to knapsacks, I have a certain volume and a certain weight. So if I select an item, it will consume a little bit of weight, a little bit of volume. And this is why I have A.I.G.. It is not that I'm trying to decide which item to put in which knapsack it is. If I select an item, it will consume some weight, it will consume some volume, and these two are limited by a maximum amount for four each. So the excise remains the same. Whether it is, it's one if an item is selected and zero otherwise. So there is no change in X I. The only change is in the cost of assigning that item or selecting that item in terms of the capacity of the different knapsacks. So if I want to maximize the utility or the profit of the selected items, so it remains the same as before, the cost constraint is different because now I have for each knapsack, I have a certain amount of usage that I cannot exceed. So in the first knapsack, be one is the its capacity. So whatever I use, let's say b one is the maximum weight that you can use. [00:08:13:13] And if I use, if I select one item, put it in the knapsack, it will consume certain volume and certain weight. So I need to capture both constraints. Clearly, you may have more than weight and volume. You can have some other types of resources that you are going to use for selecting an item. So a project may be, for example, a project can take. It has a cost in dollar values it. It may have time and you have a maximum amount of time. It may have a certain number of people work on it. So that's the third knapsack it may have it may have different type of resource that you use. And the fourth, so you can have up to knapsacks in terms of in terms of resources used and you want to select the items to maximise the value but not exceed any of the capacities on any of the knapsacks. So that's the formulation that general formulation for for the problem. So imagine if you have eight items and they have a certain amount of profit associated with them, they can be a project, let's say, and knapsack one can represent the the cost of the project. Knapsack two can represent the duration, and Knapsack three can can represent the number of people working on it. So what you want is to pick the items that will maximise the profit just like before, but you don't want to exceed any of the constraints on the three knapsacks. [00:09:45:17] We are limited for Knapsack one by 82 65 and the second one and 51 on the third one. The formulation is the general information is just like this one. If you break it down just to make sure we understand how the formulation is done in this specific case, I want to maximise the profit. So nine by x j whether an item is selected or not. Five by x two. So nine by X1, five by x two. The profit by whether an item one is selected, item two is selected and so on. The constraints are the cost for the item in the first knapsack in 19 and multiplied by whether an item is selected or not. The summation of all of these costs in the first column must be less. Are not equal to 82. And the second knapsack, the cost takes 113 x two and so on. It must be less than 65, and the last one is less than 51. Of course, they all binary, all decision variables are binary, so it's important to emphasise that in this case, my job was not really or my objective was not really to assign items to specific knapsacks. This ends up being an assignment problem with, you know, trying to figure out which knapsack to fit that item in. That's not really what I'm trying to do here. [00:11:09:15] What I'm trying to do is to select the items to maximize the profit. But each item, as if it's a it's it has three sides to its cost. One side is the first knapsack and the other side is the second. One third side is the third one. So think of them as volume, weight and something else, some other type of resource that you will that you will consume. So it is it is. It's important that we don't look at this problem as if we're assigning items to knapsacks, but rather we are selecting items, but we need to respect the cost associated with each knapsack. So if I take this? Let me quickly demonstrate how you can do this in Excel. So this is the Mkapa, the multidimensional knapsack problem and the in this case, here is my data. These are my decision variables. The 011. Initially, I don't know any of these selections. The these are the eight items these are given to me profit and costs for each knapsack. This is the total, the right hand side or the total cost for each knapsack. And this is how much I'm going to consume if I select from knapsack one. If I select Item one and from Knapsack one, if I select Item two from Knapsack one, if I select Item three and so on. And this sale represents the same thing that some product of the cost multiplied by the selection for the second knapsack. [00:12:45:20] And my objective function is to maximize the profit, the sum product of the profit by the selection. Insolvent. I will select this as my objective function I want to maximize. And the decision variables are given to me here and they are binary. So this selection is for binary decision variables, and I want to make sure that each cell of these is less than or equal to the corresponding cells over here. And if I look at my options, I don't have this ignore integer constraint because otherwise may give me fractional values. The algorithm that I will use is the simplex, because this is a linear algorithm, a linear problem. You can always select this option. It doesn't hurt, although you don't need it in this case, because the the variables are defined as binary. But I recommend that you always check this just in case, just in case that the problem was a little bit different. And then you forget to check this on when I had solved solver will give me the optimal solution, and its solution is 68 by selecting items three, four, five, seven and eight. And if you look at the usage I used from the first knapsack 80, the second knapsack 52 and the third one 49, and that would be my optimal solution for this, for this problem.",2932,"[ 0.01753172  0.00775897  0.01533367 ... -0.00970694 -0.02053264

Another application of integer programming in this application, said K, is considered to be covered by a family of sets f if each element in case belongs to at least one of the sets and f, in other words, if I have a set of numbers from one to seven and this is represented by Set K and I have a set of sets, which is F, it's a it's a it's a set that consists of several sets we consider K to be covered by F if each number of or each member of the set K belongs to at least one of the subsets and set F. So in this case, for instance, one belongs to the first set and it also belongs to the third set. Two belongs to the second one only. So as long as it is covered by one of the sets, then each member of the set K is covered by one of the sets and f then we are got the set K is considered to be covered. If I even if I have only one set covering each member, then it's still we're still OK. If in some cases there could be just like, for instance, set three member three number three is covered by this. The last two sets and set f set F is really a set of sets or subsets. And the question is what is the minimum number of sets in f that is needed to cover all the items in K.. [00:01:54:18] There are many applications for this type of problem. Let's take a look at an example where a mail service company needs to add a distribution hub for their mail. At certain cities such that there is a hub within 100 miles of each city, so if I have some bunch of cities and all the cities that are within 100 miles of each other, I want to have them covered by one hub. There is no limit on how many cities a hub can cover, but I want to find the minimum number of hubs because this means that I would reduce the cost of setting up these hubs in order to cover all the cities. If I have a total number of 12 cities in this example and the cities within 100 miles of each other of each city or of each other are given in the following set on the next slide. What is the minimum number of hops required? So these are my 12 cities right here, and in each row I define the cities that are within 100 miles of each other. So city one is, of course, is within 100 miles of itself, but also city and set for city, three and 38 are within 100 miles of each other. So I want to make sure that I have enough hubs to cover all the cities, but I want that minimum number of hubs. If I can do it with one, that would be great, but it can't. [00:03:26:00] Then we go to two or three and four and so on. So before we go over the model, if if I define a decision Variable X I. A binary variable, that's one if a hub is set up in City I and zero otherwise, then you can imagine having x one x two x three and so on until x 12. And this is a binary variable zero or one. So if I need to set up a hub and city one, then it will be. It will have a value of one. If I need to set up a hub in City to, then it will have a value of one as well and so on for all of the cities. To model this problem, I defined my decision Variable X I as just I as I described and I want to minimize the total number of Hubs X I represents the hubs. If it's one, then there is a hub, if it is not, if there if there is no hub, it is zero. I add them up over all cities. So NW is the number of cities X I is the number of hub at city. I subject to that. The summation of the the values of the decision variables over the subset of the of cities must be greater than or equal to one. So if I go back here, I want to make sure that if X one x three and x eight must be greater than or equal to one meaning I need at least one hub to cover these three cities. [00:04:57:17] In the second one, I will have x two plus x nine greater than or equal to one and so on. So as you can imagine, if I have one hub in city one, then cities one, three and eight are covered. Also, cities one and three are covered by the same hub that I may set up in city one, but not hub, not city one, because it's not a member of this set. The first set, however, 11, may get covered using some other hub. It doesn't have to be covered with the same with the same hub. So that's the that's the idea here. And so I have to have this constraint greater than or equal because a city can be covered by more than one hub, it doesn't have to be exactly one hub. And the other constraint is the binary constraint of I of X II is a binary either zero or one to show you how we do this in an excel. This is a snapshot of the solution, but here is the model itself. Where I have my cities and I as a starting point, I start with no hubs allocated anywhere. So these are my decision variables and this is my objective function, which is simply the summation of X I from one to 12. And the constraints are important here, where they reflect the condition that a city must be at least covered by a hub. [00:06:27:01] So, for instance, City one, it is within 100 miles of itself of City three and City eight. So the summation of these is greater than or equal to one, because these are cities within 100 miles of each other and one hub. If I set up a hub in any of them, then they will get covered. The same thing with the second one, where City two and City nine go back to the previous slide and you will see that City two and 39 are within 100 miles of each other and so on. So this column, every cell in this column represents a constraint, and I want this constraint to be greater than or equal to zero in solver. I minimize the summation over here, minimize and my decision variables are given here. These decision variables need to be binary. So this is a set of binary variables and the constraints of the distances the cities within 100 miles of each other must be. The decision variables added up in each cell must be greater than or equal to one for cities that are within 100 miles. So for instance, in this case, by the way, this constraint, this is multiple constraints that will include will enforce the constraint for each role. It's not just one constraint, actually, it is 12 constraints because I need to enforce this constraint for each set that is within 100 miles of each other. [00:08:11:12] When I hit, remember, this is a linear model, so I will use the Simplex LP. You can always select this option. However, it's not, and it's not necessary in this case because I have binary variables. It doesn't hurt if you leave it checked on, and that options just make sure that this option is not selected because I have to have integer values for XY or 0.1 variables for values for XY. If I hit solve what the solution tells me, that if you set up a hub in City one and City five, six and nine, that will cover every single city so we can verify a total of four four hubs, we can verify this. So for instance, if you look at city, one hub in City one will cover one, three and eight. So now I don't have to have a hub in three because it's covered by one and I don't have to have a hub in eight, although I may if it is needed for some other cities. If you look at two and nine, remember that I don't have to have a hub in every city. So in two, I don't have a city, but two and nine are covered by bi hubs that are already included and some other locations. In this case, it will be a hub in nine, will cover two and nine and so on and so forth. [00:09:33:17] So if you take another one. Number three, I don't have anything in number three because one is one and three are covered by the hub in city one and no one is covered by No11 is covered by the hub in No. Nine. That is the minimum number of hops I need to cover all cities. Going to a similar problem, going to a similar problem, but known as the set partitioning problem in in this problem, it's the exact same set up like the set covering problem, except now I want the subsets to be covered exactly by all the elements to be covered exactly by one subset. So instead of having a constraint that says greater than or equal to one, I will now have a constraint that says exactly equal to. One meaning I don't want a case if I go back to the previous solution. I don't want a case where, for instance, one city one is covered by the hub and city one and the hub some some other place in some other place. Let's take, for instance, a city for City. Four in this case is covered by hub in City five and in City six because it belongs to both subsets. I don't want that situation. I want a city to be covered only by one hub. This is you can think of an application where if you have the distribution, not distribution center, but more of retailers that they are in charge for certain territories. [00:11:16:23] So if you have one retailer covering some area in the East Coast, and that's the only retail retailer that's allowed to distribute their goods of a certain manufacturer and to remove competition, they may just give that retailer exclusive rights in certain area. And in this way, you want that retailer. You want the the smaller retailers to be covered by that particular distributor only you don't want competition among the distributors in some cases. So that would be a set partitioning problem. If we try, let's try to. Let's try to go back to excel and solve this problem as a a set partitioning problem. So if I do a set partitioning problem, it will be the same exact setup, except that in solver, I will change this constraint and make it equal to one. Ok. Set it to equal to one not greater than or equal to. And I attempt to solve the problem again. The exact same model when you solve, try to solve this. It tells you that there is no feasible solution. In other words, the cities are so overlapped that it is impossible to find or to set a hub that will cover the city exactly once. This is why you get an infeasible solution, so this solution is not the optimal solution for the set partitioning problem. This is a solution only for the set covering problem. This is why I have a note here that says in feasible solution as a set partitioning problem.",2610,"[ 0.02701714  0.0044885   0.0205643  ... -0.00752611 -0.01311769

Integer Programming Application (The Facility location Problem),6.5,IP,"Title: Integer Programming Application (The Facility location Problem); Description: Integer Programming Application (The Facility location Problem); Transcript: [00:00:02:19] Let's now take the facility location problem as an application of integer programming. In this problem, we need to decide where to locate facilities. They can be warehouses or they can be plants or factories so that they serve a certain amount of demand in different regions, such that we minimize the total fixed costs and variable costs. In some cases, we may also want to decide whether to leave a certain facility opened or closed. So if we have more capacity than necessary to meet the demand, we may choose to close a facility. And the question is which facility do you close if you have 10 of them? Which one should you close to minimize the cost? The fixed cost is the cost of the building or the cost of leasing a building. It's a cost that is not dependent on the amount of production. So it is it's something that you will have to pay regardless how much you produce and ship. While the variable cost is the amount that is dependent, the cost that is dependent on the production amount. So the cost per unit, so the more you produce, the more the cost. So let's take this example to to demonstrate the problem. We have a company that produces vehicles, and so you had five factories or plants that they produce and ship to four warehouses or four areas, and the production capacity is given to us and the fixed cost is given to us. So the production capacity of the different plants is given here. [00:01:45:11] So 12000 vehicles per certain time unit, maybe per year, and the annual fixed cost is two million 100000. And that amount you will pay, regardless of how much you produce the cost of shipping or producing and shipping, you can think of it this way. It's given this matrix where it costs, let's say, $56 or everything is in thousand, so 56000 to ship a thousand units. So this is $9000 for per 1000 units. So it will cost 56 to ship from planet one to warehouse one. It will cost 21 to ship from plant one to warehouse two and so on. Now, this entry may also include the production cost. It doesn't have just to be the transportation costs. It may include a bunch of things that are a bunch of figures that will represent the cost of producing, shipping, delivering, unloading, loading, whatever everything from plant one to warehouse one. So the question is given that we have a certain demand that we need to meet. And given that given that so the demand will be given to us, given that we have, we know the capacity of each plant, we know that the fixed cost and we know the variable cost which is represented here by the transportation cost. How much should we ship from each plant to each warehouse and which plant should leave open and which one should be closed to minimize the total fixed and variable cost? So to solve this problem, we first introduce a the mathematical model, the integer programming model, and then see how we implement it in Excel. [00:03:34:11] So if I represent these are as my plants. So I have planned one two, three four five. And these are my warehouses. One, two, three four. I have each plant has seven capacity. Capacity. So this is the capacity for plant one plant to the 12000 and so on. And it has each plant has a fixed cost FII. So. F.i is the fixed cost. For Plant, I. And Kai, is the capacity. For Plant, I. And if we define a decision variable or before we start the decision variables, let's look at the warehouses and look at the demand. So I have demand here on this end. Demand. So the demand would be, let's say, the one, so the demand is for each warehouse, the two and these are given numbers to us. They were not mentioned in the slide, but they will be provided by the problem. And so what we want to decide is, first of all, do we need all of these? And if we don't? Should we close one or more of them? And which one should we close? This is one decision. Another decision is if I'm going to ship from one, let's say, from this plan to this warehouse or from this plan to this warehouse, it can I can send to multiple warehouses. There is nothing that prevents me from doing that. And if I or if I ship from here to here, so we're trying to decide the routes for the shipments, in other words, where should I be shipping from to. [00:06:12:22] Ok. And so on for all of them? Ok. So and so on for all of them. So potentially I can ship from any plan to any warehouse. And what is the most cost effective thing to do to ship from which plan to which warehouse? So we have two decisions to make. One is to decide which one would be closed, which one will remain open, and the second would be where to ship the vehicles from and to which warehouse how much we should ship, how much we should ship and according to which route. So we need to define decision variables. So this is what's given to us and also we are given the cost of transportation. So these are the parameters of the model. Parameters of the model, CIJ is the the transportation cost or production and transportation costs. The cost of shipping. From I to J. Ok, so these are all information. This information is all given to us capacity demand and the cost per unit. Now, let's define a decision variable if I define. First of all, let's define the amount that we need to ship. So if I say Xia is, the idea is the number of vehicles. To ship. From. I. 2g, the amount that I need to ship and that will by default, also provide me with the route that I will take from which node to which node will be connected. [00:08:03:13] And the second fact, the second decision variable that I should define is why or why? Why I, which is a binary variable that has the value of equal to one if plant. I is opened. And zero otherwise. So it's a binary decision variable, it's either one or zero if it's open or closed. Now using these decision variables and parameters, my objective is to minimize Z, which is equal to variable cost and fixed cost, variable cost plus fixed cost. Let's start with the variable cost, the variable cost is basically depending how much I ship. So if I ship exigé from one to and from I 2J at the cost of CIJ at the cost of CIJ, it means that if I ship one unit, it will cost me CIJ. If I ship two units, it will be to buy CIJ. If I ship EXI Unit Exigé unit, it will be CIJ by exigé the so total submission across all arcs. So I will add up everything. So if I don't ship anything from, let's say, three to one, that variable value exigé will be zero and that it will drop from the objective function. So to represent this, it will be the summation, the double summation of CIJ Exigé from. I equal one to RN in this case, I have how many I have here, this would be an. Equal to five, and this will be, let's say em. For so I will ship from I equal one to five or to. [00:10:02:07] And this way it will be one to four. So let's let's look at this formula. If I set out to equal to one, which means that I'm at the first node right here. Then I will take the internal summation. This summation right here, and I will go through all the notes that the shipment will be going to from one to four go from one to four. So in other words, I will say, OK, let's multiply the cost per unit by Zeiger from the first note to the to the first load to the second node, to the third node to the fourth node from the first plant, plus the second plant and add the cost to all warehouses. Third plant and so on for all five of them. This way you have the exigé by CIJ for every arc in this network, OK, for every arc in this network. So that's the variable cost. And if I don't ship anything from one location to another, it will be a zero and that cost component will drop. The second part of the objective function is the fixed cost, which is simple. If I have a plant opened it, the fixed cost is if I. So if I add this one to five or to end, that will give me the total fixed cost. But because some plants may be closed down, I need to multiply it by this variable y, which is a zero or one. If it's open, then I will multiply by one. [00:11:30:05] So it doesn't really change the value of F, and if it's closed, it will be zero and it will drop from that term will drop from the cost. So it let's say, if I if I close two plants, then you will have only three terms that will contribute towards the the fixed cost. Now this is a decision variable that the model needs to decide what is the best values for Y to set them to one or to zero in order to meet the demand. So that's my objective function. Let's now look at their constraints. We have two main categories of constraints. We have the capacity constraint and the demand constraint. So let's start by looking at the capacity constraints, the capacity constraint, basically what we need to ensure is so subject to capacity constraint. That we don't exceed the capacity, we cannot exceed their capacity to the total amount shipped from. The total amount shipped from a certain node to all other nodes must be less than or equal to K for that node, and the capacity in Node two must be the total amount shipped from Node two must be less than or equal to the capacity at Node two and so on. So. Are. If I set up this constraint such that there's some mention of the amounts exigé from. Sent a note to all warehouses, all four warehouses must be so for I, let's say equal to one. I need to make sure that this summation, the summation is less than or equal to the capacity kaikai multiplied by why I. [00:13:26:14] And the same thing for the second one, the same thing for the third one and all the way to the fifth one. So let's go over this for the first plant. So I is equal to one. It means that I'm at plant one. So the summation of exigé, meaning the arcs that will go from one to one one to two one to three one to four. The summation of all the axes must be less than or equal to k one. And the reason I multiply here by K I. Is because I want to make sure that if there is a plant closed this capacity, this right hand side is set to zero. And when this right hand side is set to zero, the only value that will make this constraint feasible is to have a zero here. So zero is less than or greater than or less than or less than or equal to zero. So in other words, if a plant is closed, I will ship nothing out of that plant. Ok? If it is open, this value will be one and we will achieve that. We will achieve this constraint. It will be k i k one K two, whatever. So it's important to recognize why we are doing this, why we included this decision variable. If you don't include this decision variable, it means that you are implicitly assuming that all plants will remain open. [00:14:48:05] Ok? In other words, I'm not going to. Otherwise, you're going to get a conflicting results where you may end up having plant closed and the amount and something ships out of that plant. So we want to make sure that if that plant is closed. In other words, the right hand side is zero, then the left hand side must be zero for this constraint to be satisfied. So this is the capacity constraint, and to make it understand the standard format, I can just move the key III to the other side. So this would be from Jay Equal one to four minus y Ikigai less than or equal to zero. What this what I did is, I put it, in the standard format. This is the same as this is the same as saying why I. And by the way, don't ignore this part of the constraint for I equal one to five because I need to repeat this constraint for every single plant, for every single plant. So in other words, this equation or this inequality actually is not one in equality. This is not one constraint. This is five constraints. It has to be satisfied four equal, one for equal to four, I equal three, four and five. So I have five constraints. Here is not one constraint that the the by doing this, I put it in a standard format and more interesting. What you could do is to shift this around by see if you agree with me or not, why I just multiply by minus one. [00:16:25:02] The whole thing. The both sides. Why I buy K II minus the summation of X i j. J from one to four is greater than or equal to one, and that will give me, of course, for I I to five. And that will give me the. Excess capacity. So it's more interesting to write this constraint this way, although you could have left it at this stage or in this standard format, but this excess capacity, it will tell me how much is left because if I take the whole capacity minus the total amount I shipped and this second term, it will give me the leftover. So that will be the excess capacity. Ok, so this is the capacity constraint, this is the unused capacity or the excess capacity. Let's take a look at the demand constraints. Demand. Constraints. And what we want to accomplish in the demand constraints going back to this picture. The total amount received by this warehouse must be equal to the one. The total amount received by this warehouse must be equal to D2 and so on. So the total amount idea coming from not one, from Node two, from Node three, four or five. The total amount should be equal to the one in order to meet the demand. So to achieve this, then I can write it. In this way, the total amount of exigé from I equal one to five and now we have I I want to five, because because I'm receiving from any of the plants must be equal to the four. [00:18:14:21] J equals one to four. So for each node and the demand side and the markets or in the warehouses, when j equal to one, I need to accomplish this constraint for GE equal to I need to satisfy this constraint and so on. So these are actually four constraints. These are four constraints. They are not one constraint, anything that's received. Anything that's received in. Warehouse one from any of the five plants, so from coming from one, from two, from three, four or five. The total amount of exigé from one, two, three, four and five must be equal to the demand. The J. So if you actually put it in a standard format, it will be exigé minus the GE is equal to zero for GE equal one to four. Don't ignore this side of the constraint because this is what tells the model that this needs to be repeated four times and this is the met demand. In other words, we are forcing the model to meet all of the demands so the unmet demand is equal to zero. And finally, don't forget the non negativity constraints that exigé is greater than or equal to zero for all AI and GE, and also why AI is binary. Or you can just say or you can represent it as why I belongs to the set of zero one for all. I. So that's the mathematical model that is the mathematical model, and now we will look at how we will implement it in Excel. [00:20:09:14] Now in Excel, this is the optimal solution, but initially we don't know what this solution is. So all the all the IG's values are, you can start to zero and everything maybe is opened. Ok, so these are my exigé. These are my exigé, so everything here is zero. Or everything is closed, it doesn't matter how you start, this is a linear programming models, and it will always end up with the same solution, same optimal solution. And so these are my exigé and this is my why I my decision variables here is simply the sum of how much I ship from each plant. And this is given to us the production and annual cost these are given to us. This is if a facility is opened. Basically, I will multiply the decision variable why I buy the production capacity so it will be equal to the production capacity. If the capacity is opened, you will see why we are doing it this way. And finally, this is the excess capacity constraint, meaning the difference between the capacity minus the total amount shipped. So the difference between the capacity of a vehicle minus the amount shipped out of that facility if it was opened. The demand is given to us. This is given amount. The vehicles received are the summation of everything that's underneath the under, under one or under two. Here for warehouse two and so on, so this is the amounts received in each warehouse and the unmet demand is the difference between the demand and the amount received in that in that warehouse. [00:21:57:04] And this is what's given to us as the transportation costs from IAG. Now the objective function represents the total cost is the fixed and the variable cost. The variable cost is right here, the sum product of exigé by. A CIJ. So that's the summation of the double summation term, and the fixed cost is the multiplication, the sum product of the whi, which is right here. And multiplied by the fixed cost, which is right here, so there's some product I will multiply each cell by the corresponding annual cost, plus the second cell by the corresponding annual cost and annual fixed costs and so on. That will give me the total cost since I'm not shipping anything now, the cost is equal to zero now, and if I ship one unit from here, the cost will be 56. Only the variable cost. If I keep a facility open, let's say one, it will add to it the fixed cost, which is that now I have two million, 156 is the transportation cost. It's a good idea to verify this model by plugging in some variable, some values by hand and see if it calculates correctly. Now this is the objective function. The constraints are simply that I cannot exceed the capacity, so the excess capacity must be greater than or equal to zero. And the unmet demand must be equal to zero. [00:23:24:11] So when I go to solver. Insolvent. My objective is to minimize their cost right here. And the decision variables are the the yellow cells, and I included all of them because they are right next to each other, the binary and they are the integer values they exigé. These are all decision variables. They demand unmet demand must be equal to zero. There is a difference between the demand and the total amount shipped in ship to warehouse. One, two, three and four will be equal to zero and the capacity. The capacity, the excess capacity must be greater than or equal to zero. This corresponds to this corresponds to the model right here. So the excess capacity, if you go back here, the excess capacity right here must be greater than or equal to zero, actually. Now going back to excel. The final constraint is the binary, the the uh, the final constraint is this is the excess capacity, and the finally constraint is the binary decision variables that these are binary. They have to be either zero or one. Make sure under the options that this option is not selected. So we don't want it to ignore integer constraints. We don't have to. This is a transportation problem, and you will notice that you will always get integer values here and exigé. You don't have to make them to set them up to integers, but you need to set up this to binary. And this is one of the properties of the transportation problem that the solution that you will get will always be an integer. [00:25:09:02] But if you have binary variables, you have to specify that they are binary. And when I hit solve. It found a solution where all constraints are satisfied and it's an optimal solution. And with this solution, it's telling me that the UM the the facility to three and a facility to four and five would remain open and you can close facilities one and three. And that will minimize your total cost. This is how much I'm going to ship from plan two to the different warehouses. The demand in Warehouse four will be met totally from the the fifth plant. This will be this is so small number that you can consider it as zero. This is to the minus 10 to the minus 12. So that is a zero. And the demand in in for Warehouse two is met from Plan two and four. So that will give me 14000. Notice how the unmet demand is zero. So in other words, I met all of the demand. Exactly. And I have an excess capacity of 6000 vehicles out of Plant five, and this is what would minimize the total cost for me. There could be other solutions that are feasible where you can still meet the demand, but they are. This is the the solution that will give you the minimum cost if you happen. If you happen to reach a different solution with the same objective function value, it might be that this problem has multiple optimal solutions. [00:26:48:20] So if you somehow get different values in this matrix and possibly in this matrix, but they have the same objective function value with all the constraints satisfy these constraints and this constraint. It means that the problem has multiple optimal solutions, and it's very common in transportation problems to have multiple optimal solutions. So don't be surprised if you get a solution in the exercises or in the examples that different from the solution that's presented here. It's simply because it might you might have stumbled onto a different optimal solution. As long as the objective function value is the same and the constraints are satisfied, it means that we have multiple optimal solutions. So that would be the optimal solution for which facilities to keep opened and which ones to close, and how much I should ship from each plan to each warehouse. You can now reconstruct that network that we did by connecting, let's say, no two to no. One and two, No. Two and two, not three. You don't connect it to not four because it has nothing in there. Plant one is going to be closed, so it's not going to even exist in that. And that drawing plant three will be closed. It doesn't exist. So you remove it, so you will. You put only three nodes in the network two, four and five, and you connect them with these amounts to the different to the to the different warehouses. And that would be your optimal solution.",4959,"[ 0.01185451 -0.0143605  -0.00517073 ...  0.00244183 -0.02061536

Integer Programming Application - Knapsack Example,6.6,IP,"Title: Integer Programming Application - Knapsack Example; Description: Integer Programming Application - Knapsack Example; Transcript: [00:00:01:26] Let's take an example of the multidimensional knapsack problem. In this example, we have a company that's considering investing in eight research and development projects. The budget that they have is limited to $300,000 and the number of scientists that can work on these projects is limited to 40. We would like to select the projects that will maximize the total profit. So, I have eight projects, the cost associated with each project, the number of scientists required on each project, and the profit out of each project. [00:00:41:05] So, to solve this problem, let's start by formulating the integer program. First, let me define some parameters so that I can write this in a concise way. The pi is the profit of Project I and ci is the cost of Project I and si is the number of scientists required for Project I. If I define a decision variable, a binary decision, variable xi, that is 1 if Project I is selected and 0 otherwise if it's not selected. Then I can write the objective function such that I want to maximize z, which in this case, is the summation of the profit per Project I multiplied by xi, which is whether a project is selected or not from I = 1 to 8. So, if it's a 0, it will drop out of the summation, if it's a 1, it will be selected. [00:02:29:19] If you are to think about a breakdown of this, this will be 360 by x1 plus 820 by x2, and so on for all of the terms. But this is a more concise way of writing its summation of pixi. The constraints are 60. First of all, let's go back and look at the expense that we have to stick to, $60,000 for Project 1, $110,000 for Project 2, and so on. So, we cannot exceed $300,000. The summation of all selected projects cannot exceed 300. So, that can be written as the summation of cixi from i = 1 to 8 must be less than or equal to 300. If you are to break this formula down, it will be basically 60 x1 + (everything is in thousands, by the way) 110 x2, and so on, must be less than or equal to 300. It's up to you to write it in either form, but this form is more common in mathematical programming; the concise form, because it doesn't take as much space and remains clean and easy to read, especially when you have a lot of terms. [00:04:10:07] The second constraint is that we have 40 scientists and we cannot exceed that. So, the summation of sixi where si is the number of scientists from i = 1 to 8 must be less than or equal to 40. That's for from i = 1 to 8 and this is for from i = 1 to 8 as well. Again, if you break this down, it will be equivalent to having 7x1 plus 9x2 and so on, must be less than or equal to 40. [00:04:46:21] Now notice here that I have two knapsacks, so it is not only that I have to stick to the cost, I also have to stick to the number of scientists. Let's go back to my slide here. If I select, let's say, Project One, the cost is 60,000 and also I have to consume from the second knapsack an amount of 7. So, you can think of the first row as an abstract that will consume some of the available space in that knapsack that represents the cost. And the second knapsack represents the space, representing the number of scientists. In this problem, we also have another requirement that says if Project Two is selected, then Project Five must also be selected, but not necessarily vice versa. So, if I happen to select Project Two, I must select Project Five. You can pause at this point and think about the constraint and how you would be able to formulate it. [00:06:08:05] This is what we need to think of: if Project Two is selected, then Project Five must be selected, but not vice versa. In other words, if x2 is equal to 1, this means that x5 must also be equal to 1. Implicitly, what this says also is that if Project Two is not selected, that doesn't have any restriction on Project Five. Five still can be selected or not selected. If neither one is selected, it's also OK. So, if we enumerate these cases, if I have to enumerate x1, x2, and x5, they can take the following values. They can either be both selected, not selected/selected, selected/not selected, and neither one selected. So, let's run through these cases one by one and see how we can formulate a constraint. If x2 is selected, then x5 must be selected. So, I want this to be allowed to happen. If Project Two is not selected, I don't really have anything to say about Project Five. It can be selected or not selected because there is no restriction. The restriction is only if you select Two, then you must select Five. But there is nothing that says if you don't select Two, then you cannot select Five or vice versa. So, this is an acceptable condition as well. This condition where you have if x2 is selected and x5 is not selected, I don't want this condition to happen because it clearly explicitly says if x2 is selected, in other words, x2 is equal to 1, then x5 must also be 1. So, I cannot have this as a 0. [00:08:20:05] So I want this condition to prevent this condition from happening and the last one, neither one can be selected. I should have a constraint that will allow for that condition as well. So, at this point, it needs some creativity to come up with the constraint. So, you may want to pause again and think about how you actually can formulate this constraint. If I include a constraint, such that x2 is less than or equal to x5, that will basically enforce this constraint where I will allow x2 to be either equal or less, but no greater than, which is this condition is the case where x2 is greater than x5. By including this constraint in the formulation, you ensure that this condition right here is not going to happen in your solution. To put it in a standard format, you can just make that difference. Move the x5 to the other side, and this will be less than or equal to 0. So, that would become my third constraint. These two are my first and second, no, that's my objective function, z. Ok, so this would be my first constraint right here, and this would be my second constraint, and the last one is my third constraint. Let's see how we can do this with Excel. [00:10:04:23] Let's bring this over here and take a look at this spreadsheet. In this spreadsheet, I have my projects, the labels of the projects, I have the decision variables, whether they are selected or not, and they will be defined as binary variables. I have the expense pi, which is a parameter that's given to me, the number of scientists si, and the profit. Actually, the profit is pi and the cost is ci, I defined it in my formulation. The objective is to maximize the profit, so I will take the sum product of whether a project is selected or not multiplied by the profit. So, it will be x1 by 360 plus x2 by 820 plus, and so on. So initially, I don't know which one will be selected. So, all 0s, I'm going to start with all 0s, and the profit will be zero, that's the objective function. The constraints are the sum product of the selected projects multiplied by the cost must be less than or equal to 300,000. Since I got everything in thousands here, I kept this as 300,000 and not how the number of scientists is a completely different unit from the cost, which is OK. So, the number of scientists that I need is the sum-product by whether a project is selected or not by the number of scientists required per project must be less than or equal to 40. [00:11:49:15] This constraint right here is the constraint that models x2 – x5 less than or equal to 0. I will add this in Solver. In Solver, I have my objective function right here, the total profit -- maximize it, and my decision variables are the cells in yellow. This constraint is the condition where if Project 2 is selected Five must be selected. So, I just make the cell less than or equal to 0. I ensure that my decision variables are binary. And finally, I make these usage cells, meaning that the cost and the number of scientists less than or equal to the right-hand side, which is given to me right here. And make sure that since this is an integer program, you don't want this option to be selected. So, you make sure that integers are not ignored, you need them to be integers or binary integers. So, if I solve this problem, I get Two to be selected, Five, Six. So, note here that I selected the maximum profit. Two and Five were both selected and Six was also selected and that would maximize my profit. I have some budget left and I have a bunch of scientists actually left, but this is the best I can do given what I'm given. [00:13:29:18] If you can say, well I have more scientists left, so maybe I can select this project as well, which will add another five scientists. But if you select this project, so you're OK with the number of scientists, but you exceeded your budget, so you cannot do that. If you select Project 4, you're going to see the same problem; you’re going to exceed. There is no project that can be executed within the limited remaining amount of money that you have. [00:14:01:25] The other thing to note is that even if we didn't include this constraint, Projects 2 and 5 would still be selected. To prove that, I can remove this constraint altogether, so if I delete this constraint, there is only binary and budget constraints are respected. If I hit solve, it still found an optimal solution and this optimal solution is the same. I still selected Two, Five, and Six. So, you may say, well then there was no need for this last constraint, it is true in this case that we didn't need it, but we didn't know beforehand. So, we need to include that constraint to represent the real condition. The solution, whether it's selected or not, I will leave it up to the Solver to decide that decision for me. So, don't remove it because this is what's required by the problem. So, I'm going to put it back in. This cell must be less than or equal to 0. I say, OK, then I hit solve again, and the solution remains the same: $1,990,000.",2432,"[ 0.00919778 -0.00173199  0.01750079 ... -0.01086891 -0.01918508

Integer Programming Application - Set Covering Example,6.7,IP,"Title: Integer Programming Application - Set Covering Example; Description: Integer Programming Application - Set Covering Example; Transcript: [00:00:02:29] This example represents a set covering problem in which we have a department store that has decided to stay open for on 24 hour basis, and the store has divided the day of 24 hours into four hour periods and determined that six four hour periods and determined that this is the demand of the demand on the number of people or the number of employees to be there. So, for instance, between midnight and 4:00 a.m., we need 90 people to work from 4:00 a.m. to eight a.m. We need 215 people to work and so on. Now, each person, whenever they show up to work, they work for eight hours. So if someone shows up at midnight, they would stay until 8:00. So there is an overlap between the different shifts. So in other words, each person who shows up to work will end up working two shifts or two segments. So if someone shows up at midnight, that person is is part of the 90 employees and also is part of the 215. Employees and we would like to the store manager wants to know the minimum number of people to assign for each of the four segment periods, the four hour segments to minimize the total number of employees. And we want to formulate a mathematical program for that so we can develop an integer program to solve this problem and minimize the number of people. Total number of people and let's start by formulating the mathematical model. So. If you think about this, I want I can define my decision variables as follows if I define EXI to be the number of employees. [00:02:12:29] Reporting. To work. At the beginning. Of period, I. Where I work for four, eight hours. And I actually it was from one to six because I have here's my I have one two, three, four, five and six, so. X1 would be the number of people reporting at midnight, so that would be the number of people to report at midnight, and they will last until 8:00 a.m. Then X2 would be the number of people showing up at four in the morning and they will stay until noon. So they keep in mind that we have to keep people for eight hours. A shift is they they work two shifts or two segments, so it's an eight hour workday. So what I want to minimize, so that would be x one x two x three and so on to X six. So my objective is to minimize C, which is equal to the summation of EXI from I equals one to six. That's my objective function. Now we need to set up the constraint so that we take into account the overlap between people between shifts when people actually show up at midnight. They don't leave at four, that the whole problem will be easy if that was the case. You just have x one equals to 90 x two equal to 215 and so on. But they don't leave at four. [00:04:09:04] They leave at eight in this case. So to model that, you can pause at this point and try to think about it yourself for a second before you see the the formulation. In this case, let me start with X one. So. I want to make sure or let's actually go to this second line for four to eight and you'll see why I started there. So people who start at midnight, they would go all the way to eight a.m. So anyone who started at midnight, plus anyone who started at 4:00, this will they will overlap. And I want the amount that amount of people, the number of people to be 215. So if you started at midnight and stay until 8:00 and then if you start at 4:00, you start, you stay until noon. But so, so so people who who serve this segment is actually those who started at midnight or those who started at. And in fact, and those who started at 4:00. So in other words, I want the X one plus x two to be greater than or equal to 215. Maybe I should list them. The constraint should be the constraints up here. And so it's one plus x two must be equal greater than or equal to 215. Similarly, those who started at four will stay until noon, so I want to make sure that people who started at four. Stay until. And stay. Stay until noon. And those who started at eight. [00:06:04:01] And will stay until 4:00 in the afternoon. There is an overlap here, so it's too. Plus, x three must be greater than or equal to 50 X three plus X4 must be greater than or equal to sixty five x four plus x five greater than or equal to three hundred and. X5. Plus, X6. Greater than or equal to 125? And finally, those who started at 8pm, they don't leave at midnight. They actually roll over until it is four a.m. So therefore the first constraint would be those who started at eight p.m., which is X6. Plus those who started at midnight X1 must be greater than or equal to 90. So these are going to be my constraints. In fact, I can just um. Move them. Over here. These are going to be my constraints and also I have to have a constraint that says EXI is binary. Four I. One to six. In fact, it's not binary, it's integer IXI is integer. It's not the binary. Let's now see how we can take this model and implemented in Excel. Let's take this model and implement it in Excel. And excel, I'm going to bring this over. In Excel, these are my shifts, and these are the number of people, so initially I start with zeros. And this is these are my decision variable. They the constraints are implemented here where I simply add the X1 plus X6 in this case, plus X1 plus X2 and so on. [00:09:10:01] For all of them and insolvent, I want to minimize the total number, which is the sum of the decision. Variables subject to these constraints must be equal to the amount of demand. So or the number of people minimum number of people. So I want to then maximize, minimize the this sell by changing. These are my decision variables and these decision variables are integers. So I make sure these are integers because I don't want to have any fractional values. And finally, this range of cells here must be greater than or equal to this range of cells. And then when I had solved. I found an optimal solution, and this optimal solution is 640 people. So what this? The way I translate this is that I can have 90 people come in at midnight and of course they will stay for eight hours, so it will be until 8:00 a.m. And then. 250 will start at four zero, will start at eight. Notice that here, I don't need anyone to start at at eight because I already have people from the previous segment from the eight, four to eight. So those who started at midnight. Plus, those who started at 4:00, they those who started at midnight, this would be my total number of people serving that, that shift. So I'm already here. So all of these are greater than or equal to the minimum amount required. And this is the minimum number of people that the minimum number of people to to schedule.",1601,"[ 0.02717618 -0.01076918  0.01627372 ... -0.00226912 -0.01658027

Integer Programming Application - Facility Selection Example,6.8,IP,"Title: Integer Programming Application - Facility Selection Example; Description: Integer Programming Application - Facility Selection Example; Transcript: [00:00:01:25] Let's take this facility selection problem and this problem, we have a city that purchased a piece of land, 55 acre piece of land, and it has a budget of 550000 to develop either fields like soccer, field rugby, football, softball, softball or baseball, or walking and running trails, playground or dog park. So all of these facilities are included in the mix to the and potentially they can be selected for development. And we have we are given a certain amount of money to invest. For each facility. So I have a certain cost for each facility, these are the different facilities. I have a certain cost. I also have a certain acreage for each facility and the total cannot exceed 55 acres. And the total budget cannot exceed 550000. And each facility has a certain capacity and the constraints where it will have certain level of usage. So a rugby field will be used by 4700 people, while a soccer field will be very 2000 people and so on. And I also have a kind of a subjective. Field, where we are given priority levels by people voting and the lower the priority, the lower the number, the higher the priority, so a soccer field will have the highest priority. Also are walking and running trails. They have highest priority. And then the second priority will be number two and third priority is number three. So a lower number means higher priority. And we want to look at this problem from different angles. [00:02:04:28] First, we want to formulate a mathematical program. That will maximize the annual usage and achieve an average priority level of no more than 175. So I want to maximize the usage of the facilities. Of course, I cannot exceed the acres, I cannot exceed the cost. And also, I want to have a minimum of one point seventy five average priorities. So when I select this facility, that will give me priority of three. If I select the second one, it will give me priority to. So if I calculate the average priority for the selected facilities, I want this average to be no more than one point seventy five. So this way I give higher priorities, meaning lower numbers on average for the selected facilities. In the second part, I want to do the same model, but my objective is to achieve the minimum average priority level and have a minimum level of usage of 120000. So in other words, now my objective becomes the the average priority level. But I have a constraint similar to how I have a constraint on the acreage and the cost. I will have a constraint of 120000 people in the usage in terms of usage that I must meet. So the minimum level of usage must be 120000 or above. And in the last case, I want to. So in the Part B, I want to reformulate the problem so that I have the minimum average priority that becomes my objective and I have a constraint on the usage. [00:03:43:28] And finally, in Part C, I have I want to focus on maximizing the acreage available. And of course, I have a constraint on the budget and and and the the average priority level of one point seventy five. So in the last case, I want to maximize the acreage utilized here and. And the limits are on the cost and on the average priority. As usual, starting with the model, let me first define my decision variable. Where? X. I. There's equal to one F facility. I had selected. And zero otherwise if it's not selected. Let's also define for the convenience of modeling defined some of the parameters that we're using, so if I define UI as the usage. Of. Facility, I and I define A.I. as the acreage of facility I. And C.I. is the cost. Of facility, I. And let's also define P.E.I. as the priority. Of facility, I. So all of these are parameters that are given to us, so these are parameters. Given parameters and exi is the decision variables so in in part A. And party, I want to formulate a linear program that will maximize the annual usage, so my objective is to maximize Z, which is equal to the summation of the utilization or the usage or why UI by exi from IE equal one to eight since I have eight types of facilities. And so if a certain facility is selected, X would be one and we will multiply one by the corresponding usage value and it will be included in the objective function. [00:06:33:19] And if it's not selected, it will be a zero and it will drop out. The constraints are that the. Acreage must not exceed 55 acres, so I ixi I one to eight must be less than or equal to 55. Maybe a good thing to do is to try to pause at this point and try to continue the mathematical model yourself as a as an exercise. The other constraint and this would would be across all facilities and the cost must not exceed. Fifty. 550000. For across all facilities, and the last constraint is, or the one before last is that the average priority level must be no more than one point seventy five. So in this case, the average priority level I can calculate it by. Taking the summation of pie by exi that will give me the total priority values from I equal one to eight if I divide this by the sum of EXI, which is the number of facilities included since EXI is a binary variable, then adding up those that have value of one will give me the number of facilities selected must be less than or equal to one point seventy five. However, this is and this goes from one to eight. However, this is nonlinear and we would like to put it in a linear format. [00:08:21:05] So one way to do that in an easy way to do that is simply to rearrange these terms. So constraint three. So this was constraint one. This is true. This is three. Then constraint three would be. Summation of pie exi will be less than or equal to one point seventy five by summation of EXI. And which means that. Summation of pie exi, I want to eat minus one point seventy five. Submission of exi from pie equal one to eight must be less than or equal to zero, so this would become my third constraint in this format. And this way it's linear and it's linear, and it's in a standard format. So this would be. This would be constrained. Three. So it's just another form of constantly that will make it convenient for me to implement a linear program. And finally, EXI is binary. Where I. Goes from one, from one to eight. Now, let's take a look at the Excel model and see how we can implement that in Excel. This is part A. Initially, I don't know what the selection of these facilities all are zeroes. So these are the different facilities, eight facilities. This is my exi. These are the parameters that are given to me, the usage, the acreage and the cost. And this is also the priority that is also given to me. What you see down here, the total of selected facility, meaning this would be the summation of EXI. [00:10:35:18] This would be the annual usage, which is the sum product of the usage multiplied by the EXI. This cell represents the acreage for the selected facility, so the air multiplied by the EXI. And this is the cost. Sigh. The cost multiplied by the corresponding selected facility, and if it's not selected, it will be multiplied by zero. And the priority is also the the priority number multiplied by IXI. So if I happen to select, let's say, this facility and this facility and this facility? Ok. These numbers reflect the multiplication of the parameter by the EXI. It's multiplied by all of them, but since these are zeros, it will not they will not count towards the total. So this is what is meant by a total of selected facilities. It's the sum product of the parameter, by the decision variable. And that gives me over here the equation, if you recall that we showed here. The equation that you see here, the summation of PI minus one point seventy five by the summation of EX on the Excel spreadsheet that shows you the G 12 is the this cell, which is the priority by EXI submission of priority by exi minus one point seventy five by the submission of X, which is right here. So I want to enforce that. This constraint must be equal to less than or equal to zero, as you see in this constraint right here. So this constraint is the implement is implemented in the purple cell that you see in Excel right here. [00:12:26:16] So in the first, so let's put this back to zero in the first part of this problem, I don't know what facilities must be selected to maximize the annual usage. So that's my objective function. My objective function is to maximize this green cell, which is the maximum usage. The decision variables are the highlighted cells in yellow. And these cells are binary. So I have a binary constraint. I also have a constraint on both of these that reflects that the acres and costs must be less than or equal to these cells, which are the 55 acres and the 550000. And finally, this priority average must be less than or equal to, well, the total priority minus one point seventy five by the total number of selected facility facilities must be less than or equal to zero, as we showed in the model. And I make sure that unconstrained variables are not negative, although this is not necessary because I have only binary variables, but I can keep it checked on, it doesn't hurt anything. And I will use the linear solver and the options remain the same. I make sure that this is not selected because I have integer constraints that I want satisfied when I had solved. Solver finds a solution, and that optimal solution is to select their football field, the playground, they walking and running trails and the software softball field. [00:14:04:27] Not how these are. The soccer field here is not selected, although it actually has a pretty high usage. But that would what optimize what would optimize the annual usage for these selected facilities. So if I take the football and the playground and the walking trail and the softball fields, they will add up to this number. That's my objective. I did not exceed the 55 acres, so I have. I used 45 and I did not exceed their budget. Take a look at this. The constraints this constraint is equal to zero, and in this cell, what I do is simply I take. That ratio of the priority multiplied by the priority, multiplied by the selection. So Pi exi summation are divided by the total sum of exi that will give me the priority level just to make sure I'm getting the actual. This constraint is linked to the cell, so I'm just want to make sure that I'm getting an average priority level of one point seventy five or less. So it hit that one point seventy five it was satisfied. Now note also that this cell is not really part of the model, only this cell is part of the model if you include this cell in the model. Instead, it will become non-linear and solver wouldn't find a feasible and optimal solution for the linear model. So the only reason I included this average priority is just for verification purposes that I'm getting an average priority level of one point seventy five. [00:15:46:11] And that would be my optimal solution with respect to maximizing the annual usage, which is the solution to Part A. In Part B, we want to formulate the problem such that the objective is now to minimize the average priority level while achieving an annual usage of at least 120000 people. So to model the problem in this context? This would be. And following the same notation, my objective function would be to minimize Z, which is the priority. The average priority level by IXI are equal one to eight divided by. Some mention of X, I now know that this is a nonlinear objective function, and I need to simplify it, since this is an objective function, not a constraint. I don't have anything on the right hand side. I can just think of this logically that minimizing this objective, minimizing this term over here is the same as minimizing the total term. It will go in the same direction because all what we are doing here is dividing by a constant, which is the summation of EXI. So this would be this is equivalent to. This is equivalent to minimizing. The summation in the. Numerator. So it will not be the exact same answer, but it will be the same result in terms of in terms of selection, you can try this yourself because by the end of the day, if I select if if I'm minimizing the if this goes up, this will go up. [00:17:55:22] If this goes up, this will go up. And by the end of the day, I'm dividing by a constant, which is the submission of the selected facilities. So and that will not affect my decision. If you divide by a constant or you add the constant or you subtract the constraint from the objective function does not affect the the solution. It will affect the value of the objective function itself, but not the actual solution of which facilities to be optimally selected. So this is equivalent, so then I can minimize, so that's minimizing the average is the same as minimizing the total, although not literally the same, but it is equivalent in terms of an objective function to drive the model into finding an optimal the same optimal solution. So this way, I will minimize the which is the summation of PI Ixi. My constraints will be again, the the the acreage will be I I must be less than or equal to 55. Because it must be X, I must be less than or equal to 50 550000 from our equal one to eight. And finally, the last constraint is the usage or the one before last is the usage, which is UI. Ixi must be greater than or equal to 120000. And finally, exile is a binary variable for all I. If I implement this model in Excel, you see here, this spreadsheet labeled B Part B. Again, I have the same model, the same setup. [00:19:53:20] These are my decision variables. Initially, I don't have any selection. Ok. This is my usage, acreage and cost, and this is my priority. Again, this is the sum product of the column multiplied by the excise, the excise. So whether all of these are the same product. This one is the summation IXI. Ok, now this is the annual usage. Now I have to have an additional constraint. My objective now no longer the annual usage, it's now the priority level, which is the summation of RPI excise. So that's my objective function. The submission of PI by EXI. And this cell is just a verification cell, as you will see in a second in solver, that becomes my objective function. The green cell is my objective function. I want to minimize, minimize. They are the the I want to minimize the cell. The green cell by making my selection. So I want to minimize the priority because the lower the priority, the higher the lower the number, the higher the priority. Again, the decision variables are binary. This. Annual usage must be greater than or equal to 120000. This is the additional constraint that I have in this case. These two are the same as before the same constraints. These acreage and costs must be less than or equal to these two cells. And when I had sole. The model was able to achieve a total priority of four OK and a minimum usage of 120000. [00:21:37:11] There you go. The blue sell at the Acreage 48 and the cost was actually at the level, at the binding number. So it was 550000 and the priority level achieved was a total of four. On average, this is just a verification cell that shows you the average if you divide this, if you divide this by the total number of selected facilities, three, that will give me the average, but how this average is less than one point seventy five, although the one point seventy five was not part of this part of the problem, but as a an observation. In this case, we minimize the total priority, which will also minimize the average priority. The average is simply the total divided by a number, so that number does not really affect the final decision, whether you divide by three or divide by two. It doesn't really affect the selection of the facilities, and that would become my new optimal solution, not how the cost is higher in the solution. The usage is 120000 compared to the usage here in the first part was 123 thousand, so the usage here is actually higher. I was trying to maximize the usage, but at a lower cost in part B, because we focused on that priority, we gave the the priority, the survey of people. What they want is the objective that we're trying to optimize. The answers are different now. My solution is to do the soccer field playground and walking and running trail compared to Part A in which we went with the football field, playground walking and trail and soft softball field. [00:23:32:13] So the walking and running trail is common. And also, the playground is common between both. The difference is the soccer field versus the football field. In part, see, I have a requirement where I want to find the facilities selected or the combination of facilities selected, will that will use the maximize that will maximize the acreage available without exceeding budget and achieving an average priority level of no more than 175. So in this case, our focus on maximizing the utilization, not in terms of number of people, but rather in terms of acreage. So going back to our formulation again, you're following the same notation I want to maximize in this case. So this is part see, I want to maximize in this case see which is equal to the summation of the acreage by X I. Subject to the cost must not be exceeded. And the. The priority level must be less than or equal to. One. The average priority level must be less than or equal to one point seventy five. So again, we rearrange this one, we rearrange this one so that we have a linear constraint. Minus one point seventy five. The summation of X I. Must be less than or equal to zero, just like in part, what we did in part a of this problem. [00:25:41:06] So. I would also I would also put a constraint on the acres, because that's a reality, we are having to stick to 55 acres. So the summation of. I I. We'd have to be less than or equal to 55, and exi is binary for all I. And excel. This is part see where my initially, as I said, I don't know what my optimal selection is, and this is my objective now to maximize the acres, to maximize the acres, and I have to stick to the cost and the the cost and the amount of acres and achieve a priority level of no more than one point seventy five. So and solver, that's my that's my objective function is to maximize, maximize this. The green cell, the decision variables are still the same and they must be binary. And also, I have to respect the number of acres and the cost, not how they save. The objective function is also included in the constraints set, so I made sure that the acres are less than or equal to 55. Even if you don't include it in this particular case, it will not be exceeded because then the cost becomes the binding constraint. And it happened to be not to exceed the the the acres of 55, but to be on the safe side. You want to include that the acres cannot be more than 55. So the same as before the cost and acres are are less than or equal to these numbers 55 and 550000. [00:27:36:16] And finally, the average priority level must be minus one point seventy five by the total submission of EXI must be less than or equal to zero. And this this last sell is only for verification purposes. So when I had sold. It gives me a number here, which is the the this constraint in the proposal is the priority restriction, and that is the verification that the average priority is something meaningful, so it is less than one point seventy five. The solution here is to do the to build the rugby field, the soccer field and the walking on running trail. If I want to maximize the acreage or the number of acres used, so the maximum I can use is 52 acres and the cost is at the cost of five or five. So between all of these scenarios, someone can actually take a look and see what is the best solution among all three scenarios. Should I, you know which one should I select, given that if my focus was the usage of people versus the usage of acres versus the priority and it becomes a little bit of multi objective optimization where these are two or three different types of objectives and you have to decide on the trade of which one do you want to go with given the the requirements for our problem? These are the optimal solution for the three different requirements given to us.",4550,"[ 0.02274315  0.00235481  0.01674224 ... -0.01335817 -0.00753538

So you imagine you can have some factories where you can produce a certain product and you have a set of customers like retail stores, for instance, where you want to ship that product to and each. Sauce is capable of producing a certain amount of capacity and certain it has a certain capacity, and it's capable of producing a certain amount of products and the destinations, they have a certain amount of demand that they want to meet and they cannot. Clearly, we cannot exceed the capacity of our sources and we should try to meet the demand for our customers. They are to achieve this in linear programming. We must model the problem so that it includes some constraints that limit the amount to be shipped from the sources to the destinations to exceed the capacity of the factories. And also, we want to put constraints that will make sure that the demand will be met if the amount or the capacity of our facilities are the same as the total amount of demand for our customers. This means that we have a balanced problem where the supply is equal to the demand and if we and in this case, we use equalities in our equations. [00:01:39:28] But in the more general case, if the if we have more capacity than our demand, we will have inequalities to show that we may have excess capacity. The objective in any transportation model is typically to minimise the transportation costs. So if you're sending products from sources to destinations, you're trying to minimise the total transportation costs. So you want to find that allocation in a way to minimise the cost. So let's take an example to explain how how the structure of the problem and how we go about modeling it. Suppose that you have three sources of products for a product, meaning three factories. So you have, let's say, three factories here that they produce certain products and they must be transported to four different destinations. One two three four. And there is a cost associated with transporting these products from the sources to the destinations, and the cells here represent the cost per unit or 100 units, whatever. However, the problem is set up. So for instance, if you transport from source one to destination one, the cost per unit is 500, while if you transport from one to two, it is 750 and so on. So that's my transportation cost per unit, and this is given to me. I know this in advance. I also have a certain capacity. For my father in my factory, so I have, for instance, at the first factory, I have a capacity to produce to provide 12 units, or this can be in hundreds of units or thousands of units, depending how the problem is set up. [00:03:30:04] So in this case, I have 12 units, and the capacity for the second source is 17 and for the third source is 11. The demand is equal and across all customers or all destinations, and it's equal to 10. It doesn't need to be equal. It may be, in most cases they are. You have different demands, but suppose that in this example, we have equal, equal demands. So this problem can be set up as a network where you have a supply and demand. The supply is represented by nodes, one with a capacity of one of two with a capacity of 17, three with a capacity of 11. And the demand is represented by nodes, one with with demand 10 two and demand 10, three and four with demand 10. And we would like to figure out where to ship from and to which to which destination in order to minimize our cost. So it can be that I may shift from one to one. At the cost of C1 one, the C1 one is a given coefficient, in this case, it's 500. It's given to us. We already know it beforehand. So that's the cost of transporting the transportation per unit. Ok. And or I can send from one to two at the cost of C1, to which in this case would be 750 and so on for three and four. [00:05:04:23] I can also ship from two to one at the cost of C2. One, which is in this matrix will be 650 or to two at a cost of 800 per unit and so on for three and four and the last one from three to one or three to two or three to three or to four. This problem, when I have these errors, it doesn't necessarily mean that I need to transport from every one nor to every other single to every other node. But it means that these are all the possibilities, and I want to know what is the best route to send these shipments through in order to minimize my total transportation costs. In this case, if you add up all of the supply, it's for you and all of the demand it's for you. And we call this problem a balance problem, which is a special case of the unbalanced problem. So how do we how do we create a linear programming model for this problem? If we define the number of units to ship from I to J as Exigé, so CIJ is the coefficient, which is represented by 500, 750 or 300, but Exigé is a decision variable that's unknown at this point, and we are trying to determine the values of Xigaze so that we minimize the total cost. Our objective is easy to see because I'm trying to minimize the total transportation cost, which is if I ship from not one one one to one, then I will be charged 500 per unit. [00:06:40:06] So if I ship X units, it will be 500 by x one one plus x one two by 750. So I will have to list all the possibilities of shipping from Node one to Node four and multiply the corresponding cost per unit by that value by that X. So you will have four node one, you will have these four terms and for No. Two, you will have these four terms because according to this, I can ship from one to one or two, two to three or to four. So if I, I need to, I need to account for all possibilities by multiplying the C1 one, which is the 500 by the amount that I need to ship across this route, which is x 1:1 plus C one two, which is 750 by x one two and so on. So I do it for the first node, then I do it for the second node. Then the third node. And this is why you see here the first four terms. They are from node one to any to all other nodes. And the second four terms, it's from Node two to all other nodes, and the third four terms are from Node three to all other nodes. Now I need to think about my constraints. [00:08:02:05] How do I make sure that I don't exceed the capacity and I meet the demand? These constraints, the first three they are the they ensure that the capacity is not exceeded. And in fact, you see all we have all equal sign because we have a balanced model. They ensured that everything that's produced is shipped to its destination, to our destination. So just to show you how these constraints they came to existence. Let's take an example of Node one, our source. It may you may ship to x one one to not one or x one to two no two or x one three to Node three. So I have the all four possibilities shipping from Node one to one, two, three and four or four with these amounts. And I want to make sure that the capacity at this node is not exceeded. And. This constraint will ensure that the amounts shipped out of not one, so x one one plus one x one two and one three and one four is equal to 12. Everything that we produce here will be shipped out, and we listed this constraint as an equality simply because we know that the problem is balanced because when we add up the the capacities and add up the demand, they are equal so we can set it up as an equal sign. We'll show you what happens if it wasn't, if this wasn't the case and the capacity may exceed the demand. [00:09:49:24] So similarly, you can set up the four No. Two and four, not three. This constraint, so it will ensure that anything that's shipped out of a certain node will be equal to the capacity and for the destination as far as the destination. Anything that so that was for the for the capacity constraint, as for the destination, so assuming that assuming that you have a. Three different sources from which you can receive as a market or as a customer, you as a destination here must be must have your demand satisfied from these three notes. It doesn't matter which one, as long as they add up to the same amount of 10. So that's how we ensure that anything that's going into destination one must be equal to 10. So this constraint right here, it shows you that anything that's going into not one to one or three one one one two and three one is equal to 10. The same thing for no. Two, not three and not four. You must have four nodes equal four constraints because you have four different destinations. So this is how they and finally the the the non negativity constraint must be listed. This is how we came up with this model for this problem. So let's now go to excel and see how we actually can solve this problem. And excel, I have the spreadsheet set up, so initially these are the decision variables and you don't know what's in them, so it is everything you can start from. [00:11:39:05] Everything is zero. So the decision variables or the X one, one x one two and so on. These are in the yellow cells right here. This is my demand for each destination. So the destination of one, two and three for the demand for it is listed here and the supply for the sources are listed here. The supply is listed here for source one, source two and three. As you noticed, if you add up all of the supply, it's 40 if you add up all the demand. It's also 40. The amounts received and shipped that you see here, so the amount shipped, let's say basically you have a formula that will add up anything that ships out of not one. So if you look at this formula, it's the summation of these cells. Anything that ships are of node one, the same thing for No. Two and three. And as far as the amounts received, it will be the summation of anything that's received by this destination. So it will be the summation of these three cells for this one, for this destination, these these cells, for this destination and so on. So initially I buy I don't have anything in my decision variables, and my cost is to minimize the total transportation cost, which is really the sum product of the decision variables that you see here by the coefficients. [00:12:58:06] So cigs by the zigs. And you add them up. So what this will do will take this cell, multiply it by this cell, plus this cell, multiply it by this cell plus this cell by the cell and so on for all 12 cells and in. I want to minimize this objective function. So and the constraints that we need, we will, as you would see in software, we want to make sure that the total amount shift from source one. In other words, this cell must be less than or equal to or in this case, because it's balance, it must be equal to 12. If I had more capacity and then I will have to put less than the amount shift would be less than or equal to 12. But for now, this is a balanced problem. So I'm using I'll be using an equal sign. And as far as the demand, the total amount received must be equal to this to the cell. So when I go to solver. The cell to minimize or to yeah, to minimize is the green cell here activated minimize by changing the decision variables which are activated over here. Now my decision, my constraints are the total amount shipped for each from each source must be equal to must be equal to the total they supply because this is a balanced problem. And the second set of constraints is that the total amount received in each destination must be equal to the demand. [00:14:47:14] And when I hit, I also check this option to make sure that all decision variables are not negative. And if I had sold. I get a solution, and this solution is in this solution, also constraints are satisfied and optimality conditions are met. So if I say OK, that gives me my optimal solution, it's always a good habit to go back to the solution and make sure that it's meaningful. So if you look at your solution, it is. You're shipping to units from one to three and then 10 units from one to four. And that's a total of 12. Not as that your ship, your supply and amount shipped is equal because you made it equal and the constraint you shift from two to two nine units and from two to three eight and from three to one 10 and from three to two one. Now let's look at the demand and whether we satisfy the demand. All of the amounts received are equal to the demand. So to satisfy. Not one destination one. I shipped three from three to. 10 units, and here the shipments are received from two nodes. It's not only one. Maybe this picture that I have on the slide. We'll give you a better idea what's what's really going on, so in Node one, it ships to 110 units to three and four, so only three and four I don't ship anything from one to one or one to two. [00:16:20:14] Two ships to two and three, nine and eight units, respectively. And three ships from the three ships, 10 and one units to one and two. And that will meet the as you can see in this snapshot, you can meet the demand at a cost of 20000 to 200. So that's an optimal solution on how to plan your routes and how to ship which destination receives, it's the amount of demand from which source. The. Unbalanced transportation problem is when we have a very similar setup, very similar structure. However, the supply may exceed the demand or the demand may exceed the supply. If the demand exceeds the supply and you force it to be equal that you want the demand to be met, you'll end up with an infeasible problem. So most of the time, you may have a supply that exceeds the demand simply because in many cases, there is some uncertainty with the demand. So you cannot be 100 percent sure how, how much they demand, how much the demand is, and therefore you need to set up a little bit. Maybe your your capacity must be a little bit over. What do you think the demand is, and in some cases, you may run out of products and there will be a shortage? So in real and real life problems, this is a very common situation. And when this happens, we must use inequalities instead of equalities, but we have to be careful where to use these inequalities and in which direction. [00:18:00:12] So let's take a problem over unbalanced transportation for an unbalanced transportation problem. So suppose that oranges are shipped from Tampa, Miami and Frenzel, which are represented by sources one, two and three here to New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and Boston. And these are destinations one, two, three and four. What do you see here across the top and the. So these are my sources. These are my destinations. The shipping cost per truck load is shown here. So that's in hundreds of dollars. So that means that from source one, which is Tampa to destination one, which is New York, it will cost you $900, $900 and $4500 from Tampa to Chicago. To add sorry to Philadelphia and $1200 to Chicago and so on. So this is my transportation cost, this is my capacity, which is how much supply I have and this is my demand. If you add up your supply, it will end up 600 versus. If you add up your demand, it will be 550. So it means that the problem is unbalanced. So when the demand and the supply are not equal, it's an unbalanced problem. What we would like to do is to formulate a linear programming model that will ship that will help you plan the shipments to know which nodes will, which source will send to each destination in order to minimize the transportation cost. [00:19:33:15] So similarly, similar to what we did in the past and the previous example, we multiply the coefficient to know our objective to calculate our objective. We must apply the coefficient, which is the cost per 100 units by the amount we shift from not one to node to node one. So I will take that nine. Multiply it by x 1:1 plus fourteen by x one to plus, twelve by x one three and and seventeen by x one four. And then you do the same thing for No2 and then for Node three. This is why you have these three groups of terms that represent the three levels of node. The constraints are the same as before, so where so if you have a certain source you want to, you can ship to X one one or X1 two or X1 three or X one for two nodes one to three four, respectively. But in this case, the capacity is 200 as before. Except that now I need to make it more generic, so I need to say I cannot exceed this capacity. I don't have to. Use all of it, but I simply cannot exceed this capacity and let the model decide what is the optimal level of. A production it it should produce, not one should produce to minimize the total cost. So in other words, instead of forcing these, these three right hand side values to be equal to instead of less than or equal to, I will use the less than. [00:21:06:08] And this way I guarantee that the capacity will not be exceeded. But. And I also don't have to use all of it, because if you're going to use all of it, it means that you need to ship 600, but all of your demand is 550. So in this case, in this case, the problem may be infeasible. So the same method that we developed these three for the supply constraints, the the last four is for the demand and the same idea one, two and three sources they will ship to one. And the demand here at not one is one theory. So to make sure that the demand is met, I will force anything that's coming into Node one, which is x one one x two one x three one equal to. One theory and. The solution, if I go back to my Excel file, this is a snapshot of the solution. If I go to my Excel file, which is the unbalanced transportation problem, and I have a similar setup like the previous example, except the only difference are the numbers. Basically, we have different transportation costs. The supply is 204 each node and the demand is 130, 170 and 100 and 150. The main difference is in the constraints. So if I go here. Notice how that I force the demand, the amount shipped into New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and Boston. [00:22:44:22] They are equal to the demand. Over here, and however, the amount shipped from Tampa, Miami and Friendswood, which are here must be less than or equal to the capacity, which is the 200. When you hit, when you hit solve and you make sure that you have non-negative decision variables, when you hit solve, you found an optimal solution. And this optimal solution has a cost of 4.50. And these are the amounts that you need to ship from different sources to different to different destinations. If you go back to the snapshot here, it will give you a pictorial kind of a picture of the resolution where you say, OK, I'm going to ship from Node one to Node 130. That's going to meet the demand and the and I'm going to ship tow only from Node one to No. Two and 100 from Node two to no to. And 50, from not free to not to that will meet the demand of 170. And this is also replicated here in the snapshot, where you see that too is getting its products from Node one, two and three with different amounts. Notice also that here the demand is 550, while the capacity is 600. What would have happened if you actually made these constraints equal signs? Instead of less than or equal, you will end up with an infeasible solution because you will be forcing the shipments of 600 while all what you need is 500, so the model does not find the solution to satisfy both. [00:24:36:11] You can try this for yourself. So if I go back to solver? And instead of less than or equal to I change this to equal sign and see, OK. And then I to solve solver will come out with a message saying silver could not find a feasible solution because you're trying to ship more than what you need. So I'm going to go back to silver and change this to less than or equal to. And sort of, again, just in case. Okay, so here here is my here is my Excel solution. So this is unbalanced model. And the problem tells us that if I go back to. The first slide here in the example, the says it says that for some agreement between the distributors, the shipments are prohibited from Miami to Chicago. So then from two to three, although it costs only six $100 per truck to ship, which is cheaper than many other, almost the cheapest among all of them. It just says that you cannot do that. You cannot ship from two to three. So how do we reflect this in the model right now? We end up shipping in the solution. We end up shipping from two to three, we end up shipping actually 100 units. And what the problem says now you cannot do that. I don't want you to be shipping anything out of source, one to destination to destination three. [00:26:10:22] So you have two ways of doing this. You can either remove the decision variable x two or three altogether. So just go back to your model and imagine that there is no x two three over here as if we don't. The link does not even exist, so you can drop this altogether from anywhere in the model. That's one possibility. But what if in the future this agreement changes and you need to go back to your model and and see if this drought would be part of the optimal solution? So instead of instead of dropping it altogether, you can use what's known as the big approach in which you penalize the cost of shipping from two to three by by using a high value, let's say, a 1000. Just make it like ten times as much or 100 times as much higher than the rest of the value. So instead of having a cost of six. Then we use a cost of 1000. And in this case, the model will avoid this because it becomes as if it's a very expensive route to take. And if the model is smart, it will pick the cheapest one because it's minimizing the total transportation costs. Let's see how we do this, how this affects the solution. As you can see in the in the snapshot from the optimal solution, which is actually obtained from here, here is the prohibited. [00:27:42:26] So I increase this. All what I did is increasing the coefficient from, let's say, six to 1000 and solve again. And when you solve the exact same model, you get the solution. So this solution, which you see a snapshot of here? Basically, it's saying, OK, supply Chicago from Tampa. And as you can see, the between two and three Miami to Chicago, it's zero. The zero amounts, although it is. It's it's it was cheap to ship that way, but due to this agreement, we couldn't do it. And now the cost went up and the cost went up because we had to choose a more expensive route to ship from Miami to Chicago. It's important to keep this in mind as we you can use these coefficients to manipulate what the model does. I mean, these coefficients down here by making their values higher or lower, depending on what you're trying to accomplish or you can just set, there is probably a third approach in which you can. One approach is to use that big method. Another one is to remove x two or three, or you can just set it in the model to equal to zero. So explicitly say X to three is equal to zero, which is the same really as eliminating it all, eliminating it altogether.

By the end of this module, you\'ll have a good grasp on the basics of transshipment and how to use it for your advantage. So let\'s get started!Transshipment problem Optimization Integer programming Decision variables Objective function; Transcript: [00:00:01:13] Let's now study a problem known as the transshipment problem and see how we can formulate a linear programming model and how to solve it. The transshipment problem is an extension of the transportation problem. It is a transportation problem of a special type where in that problem, we have intermediate nodes. Typically in a transportation problem, we have a set of nodes that they represent the sources. For instance, factories and you have a set of destinations that represent the markets or the retailers and the transshipment problem, you have something in between some set of node that is in between the sources and the destinations. And this this intermediate set of nodes represents. Are possibly distribution centers or warehouses some intermediate stage that the product needs to go through before it goes to the final destination. The items can be transported from the sources through the transportation transshipment nodes or points to the destination. We may also have cases in which the flows they can go from one source to another, and they could go from one transshipment node to another and from one destination to another, or directly from the sources to the destination destinations. Keeping the transit transshipment points, which basically this number five, it becomes the usual transportation problem. Or we could have a combination of these, so we will look at this problem as a general case. In which many combinations of flaws may take place between sources, transshipment nodes and destination nodes. [00:02:02:13] Generally speaking, if we model this as a network or if we think of this problem as a network, you have basically a set of source nodes. They can represent factories or sources of products suppliers, and you have a set of destinations that represent markets or retailers or customers. They don't have to be equal the number of destinations and sources, they don't have to be equal. And in between, we have a set of nodes known as the transshipment nodes, where ore points, where they may represent warehouses, or some some temporary holding areas to exchange products or anything of of that nature where the product goes through an intermediate stage before it reaches its final destination. The products can go from one source to a transshipment node, then to the final destination to one or more of the final destinations. So here we may have only one final destination to go through Node five. So it goes, the products go from Node. So in the first case, the products go from Node one through Node four to both six and eight, while in the second case, the the the products go from Node three through Node five to nine. The other alternative would be for the products to go directly from the sources to the final destinations. As you can imagine, just like a concept of drop shipping where the manufacturer may send the final customer directly. Without going through a distribution center in case like this, also from three to nine, and we may go from one source to another. [00:04:01:20] Or we may go from one destination to another or from one transshipment node to another. So a combination of these, these different flows may occur and we need to know how to model it in general. So we will take example an example to to the ministry, the idea. So for instance, in this case, I have ports, three different ports in Hamburg, Marseille and the Liverpool, and these ports are considered the sources and they eventually need to get to to customers in Dallas, St. Louis and Chicago. To get there, we need to ship them to warehouses in the US and from the warehouses we can transport to the final destinations. So in the first stage, the products will go from the sources or the ports to the warehouses, where it costs us a certain amount to ship from one source to a one transshipment node or a warehouse, which is the know which are the nodes in Norfolk, New York and Savannah. They represent intermediate nodes. The ports, they have a certain capacity as expected, so they they can supply up to a certain amount, then once we get the products to the intermediate nodes, which are the warehouses, in this case, we need to ship from these warehouses to the final destinations at a certain cost. So the cost for its ship from Norfolk to Dallas, for instance, is $75 a unit to St. [00:05:41:26] Louis, 63 and so on. And there is a certain amount of demand that we are required to meet at the final destination. So as you can see, there can be almost two networks connected together. One network represents the sources to intermediate nodes or transshipment nodes, and then from the transshipment nodes to the final destinations. Not that the transshipment nodes here they represent a destination, a temporary destination. And then from that temporary destination, which is right here, the same as the column over here will ship to the final destination. Before we proceed with this example and how to model it, let's in general go over the notation and the formulation, especially when we have large number of nodes. We have been. Formulating problems of this nature when we have small number of nodes by explicitly using of decision variables, that represents the different sources and destinations. So we say x one four x one five x one six. So let's try to see how we can model this in general, because sometimes the network can be very large and your equations can get very large. So let's learn how to actually put this in a more compact form that's easier to put together in a small formulation, but it is understandable enough that someone can take that formulation and implement it. So. If I switch for a second to the notepad and you can take notes with me as we go. [00:07:26:19] Typically when we have a set of sources, so let's say these are the sources that I have one to. Three, all the way to A.. So I have any notes, and from these will go certain amounts each and will represent the amounts that they we shipped from a sword, from a certain source. By X one, two x one, three or simply x i j. Where I represents the source, no. So I have end sources and each source has a certain capacity k so each node I has a capacity, a certain capacity. So this one is k one. This one is K two and so on to K in. So I have here a total of A.. And if I want to model the if I want to model the. The capacity at these nodes. So I need to constraint where I cannot exceed the capacity of a specific node. So in this case, instead of saying instead of saying. I want to make sure that x one two where one is this not the source, but two is the destination node plus x one 3+ x one four. What if I have 50 nodes? Then I will have a very long equation. Must be less than or equal to one. And then you have to repeat this for the second node where you say X to one plus x two two plus all the way, maybe to 100 nodes or whatever the number of customers. [00:09:24:03] The final customers you have must be less than or equal to K2, and then you have to repeat this for all end nodes. And if you have 100 sources, you can imagine that you have a very long list of constraints and terms and the objective function. So instead of doing that, let's learn a kind of a more elegant way of representing this without really having to spell out every single term. So if we instead of using explicitly the the terms, as I just described, we instead say, OK. If I'm shipping to Exigé. From North I to J. Then the I want to make sure that the summation of all zigs, so if exigé. I want to ship to all customers, so let's suppose that you have you have here and customers, OK? And the summation of from node one to all customers from J equals one to M. So I may have 50 customers, 100 customers, all of the submissions, everything that's going out of Node one, the summation of all of these X's must be I cannot exceed the capacity of K I. Now it is. It is. This is the constraint for one node, but I have end nodes, so I have another set of constraints for these guys and other for this and other for this because I have nodes. Then instead of repeating this constraint multiple times, I can simply say that. [00:11:22:01] For every one of these notes, in other words, for. I equals one to n repeat this constraint. So the way we set this up is that whenever you see for I equals one to and it means that satisfy this constraint for not one. Two all the way to node end where every for every node you apply this constraint and you make sure that the amounts going out of the going out of Node one. For instance, they will not exceed the capacity at node one. The amounts going when you update AI to equal to two, then you say the amounts going out of Node two will not exceed the capacity of of Node two and so on. We similarly model the demand constraints by using the same concepts, but on the inside of the network, so if I have a market that that receives the amounts from various sources, so if my final market is, let's say. If my final market is J, I have X I J coming in and I have a certain demand. Demand D.J. and what I want to say in this constraint is that I want the total amount, the total amount of. There must be equal to D.J.. So I don't want to I don't want to have more than the demand for sure, but I want the demand to be met and I want to repeat this for every, for every market. [00:13:21:08] And this, by the way, the submission goes from one to from I equal one to end, in other words. If the amount of products coming are coming from. Not one, not two, not three, not end, I add all of them up. All of them up. So the summation I add, I find the summation here from all the new flows coming into A.J. and I will make sure that they are equal to D.J.. But I don't want this to happen only with one note. I want to be to happen with all nodes that represent markets. So for this to happen, I will also add that this will have to be forge equal one all the way to assuming that I have markets. A few assuming that I have a markets because we may have an J. So we may have a bunch of nodes here all the way to em. So I will make sure that when I have a father like this, it means that for the first market, I will apply this constraint for the second market. When I update to Jay Equal to two, I will apply this constraint and so on. So this compact form will take care of the constraints for the supply and demand. What is left is to deal with the intermediate constraints, the constraints for the intermediate nodes. So to in order to accomplish the the in order to make sure that the amount that's going out of into node and to an intermediate node is equal to the amount that's coming out of the intermediate node, then I need another set of constraints. [00:15:09:11] This conservation. Conservation of floor idea. It exists in networks in general for the intermediate nodes so that I don't have anything left in the inside. Anything, any products that I send to the warehouse eventually will have to come out of a warehouse or, you know, a distribution center or whatever in between the the sources and the the destination. So in order to model this problem or this part of the problem, which is the intermediate constraints. We need a slightly different set of rules that basically that says anything that goes into the node must leave the node. Yes. So these are the intermediate. And these intermediate nodes, which can be represented by Kay, let's say, Kay. Small care and capital care was the capacity. Anything that's the constraint that we need for this intermediate nodes. Anything that's coming into this node must leave and that's that's a law or it's called the the flow conservation law law, where you anything that's going into one node must come out. That's the idea. You can serve the amount of flow, assuming it's a temporary location like a warehouse where anything that's coming in must go out eventually to the to the customers. You need to have that set of constraints captured in the model, so in order for you to do that, you will say, OK, I have my exigé coming in from here and I have my X or in this case, X. [00:17:12:09] X, I care because I have the intermediate node as K and then they will leave as x k j. So the summation, everything that's coming into this node. So in other words, the summation of X i k. For all from all sources, from our equal one to N OK, must be equal to the summation from. That from. That note key to the final destination, J. And that applies to the remember that we have a flow coming out of here, a flow coming out of here, possibly another one from here. So I have to sum up over all JS. So J equals one two m. So for each one of these nodes, K for each K, I have to make sure that the total amount coming into the node must be equal to the amount coming out of the node. So and that's that's a very important constraint in transshipment and the transshipment problems. Remember that I have to repeat this constraint. Across all keys. So for the second day, I need to do the same thing for the third K one K equal one, K Equal two and so on. So that will apply for K equal one for K equals one two. [00:18:50:26] However, you know the number of transshipment nodes that you have, which could be L. Ok, so if I have L nodes here in between, this constraint must hold for all of them. So that's the constraint, the the transshipment constraint. And finally, we have for all exigé must be greater than or equal to zero x x IK as well must be greater than or equal to zero. Any combination that may exist in terms of x x IG like x k.j, all of them, they must be greater than or equal to zero. This here, if I have something like this, it indicates that the flow may go directly from the source all the way to the destination. While if I have this constraint, it means that I have to go through certain amounts may go through the intermediate intermediate flows or the intermediate nodes. So let's now use this approach to solve to model this problem. So this problem I have in this case, I have sources and this and intermediate nodes which represent the warehouses. Then from the warehouses we ship to the final destinations who have a certain amount of demand and the original nodes, they have certain amount of supply. If we look at the network. In this example, we are assuming that everything that comes from the ports will have to go through the transshipment nodes and they don't go directly from one port all the way to the destination. [00:20:32:22] In some cases, in the more general case, you may have an arrow going from one to seven, for instance, or from one to eight. In this case, we are assuming that everything has to go through the intermediate nodes. The objective function is to minimize the total transportation cost. So in other words, I will take CIJ is the cost from a per unit from I to. So the cost from the cost from one to four would be here. See one for. And if you ship a certain amount of exigé, then you multiply or x one four, you multiply this the shipment per unit, the cost per unit multiplied by the amount that you ship from one to four. So if you're shipping exigé, you multiply it by the CIJ, which is the transportation cost per unit. So I want to minimize the cost of shipping from this. The from. All of the source notes, so I sum up over all the source notes. For all of these, and so all the flaws coming out of one, two, three. So you take the first one and then you do the summation for over four five six. So this is the second submission for the intermediate nodes. So anything when I is equal to one, you will sum up the cost per unit multiplied by exigé, plus you update I now I win, I is equal to two. Then you jump to the second node and you add up the cost of shipping from node to all the way to from node two to four five six. [00:22:12:22] And finally, from Node three to four five six as well. So this is captured by these two, by this double summation that I have highlighted with the red. The second term is the cost of flows from four to seven, eight nine from five to seven eight nine and from six to seven eight nine. So you sum up over, let's use the blue. In this case, you sum up over four five six, which are here. So for each one of these, I will execute this summation. Of the cost per unit multiplied by the amount I ship, so when Jay is equal to four, it means not four right here. I will add up the all of the amounts I ship out of four to seven eight nine and multiply the cost the shipping cost per unit at them up, then move to the next node, which is equal to five and add up all of these three. And finally, jump to Node six and add up the last three nodes. So this is why you see here from Kay goes from. Seven to nine, so the case goes from seven to nine, and in this example here, there is no rule one to use or to use case. It's up to you, depending how you define it. So in this example, I define that these are the GS and these are the eyes and these are the case. [00:23:42:04] So it doesn't have. You can start with a K and with the eye. It doesn't matter as long as you stick to your way of defining things in the decision variables. So that's my objective function. I want to minimize the total cost of shipping from one note to the intermediate and from the intermediate to the final destination. Keep in mind that some of these flows may end up being zero, which is fine because then you multiply zero by the cost of shipping and you will end up that term will drop. So if I don't ship anything out of, let's say, if I ship from Node two to four only, then these amounts will end up being zero. So as if they don't exist, I will in the multiple, adding a zero term to the objective function. I will include only what will count really only is the amount shipped from two to four. From two to four multiplied by the cost per unit from two to four. Let's take a look now of the constraints and the constraints I want to make sure that this capacity is not exceeded. Ok. The capacity at each node is not exceeded, as I will, as I demonstrated earlier. You add up all of the nodes coming out of the. We add up all of the notes coming out of we add up the flaws coming out of each node. [00:25:03:17] So if I take all of the ideas coming out of I equal to one and everything coming out of one must be less than or equal to 55, anything that's coming out of two. So anything that's coming out of here must be less than or equal to 55. Anything coming out of here must be less than or equal to 78. And all the summation of all these three flaws must be less than or equal to 37. So if you look at this constraint, which is the capacity constraint, what we are doing is saying OK for each node. For each node, I so for I equal to one, I will add up the flows coming out of Node one, going to four or five and six. So the summation from J equals four to six summation from four from right here in the middle. Ok, must be less than or equal to the supply of AI, and AI is equal to one, which is the first node. Then we repeat this constraint to Node two. So for no to anything that's coming out of Node two, going to four or five and six must be less than or equal to the supply, which is supply of Node 278. So these these this constraint really is not one constraint. It's a set of three constraints depending on how many values I have for I. [00:26:34:02] So that's the supply constraint, the demand constraint, the demand constraint. Is that this is an equal sign? So the demand constraint is to say, well at this node for each node K so four K equal to seven, the anything that's going into Node seven, so anything that's going into Node seven must be equal to 60. Ok, so this is why we say when K is equal to seven, sum everything that's coming out of nodes for five or six, four, five or six must be equal to the demand at Node K, which is in this case, 60. The same thing is repeated for Node eight and four Node nine. So when you see four here, it means that you repeat this constraint three times, depending on how many values you have for K. So if you have a fourth node, then you will have seven eight nine 10. So this way we ensure that the exact amount is of demand is met. And finally, they in order to make sure that the in order to make sure that they, whatever comes in, the intermediate nodes must leave. We add this intermediate constraint where it says the last one down here, where it says for each node j, which is the nodes are in the middle for node, for, let's say, the amount coming in Node four, which are the summation of Exigé, where it goes from one to three one two three way. [00:28:30:13] Anything that's coming from one to three into Node four must be equal to the summation of anything going out of Node four to seven, eight and nine. And therefore you see the submission from K equals seven to nine. Where K is the final destination in this case? And this way, this way, I make sure that whatever comes into Node four is going to leave node for go to the final destination. The same thing applies for Node five and Node six as intermediate nodes. So in this way, and the sign here is an equal sign. The sign here is an equal sign to make sure that the demand is met. One thing whenever we use the equal signs, we have to make sure that there is enough supply to meet the demand. So if the demand is higher than the supply, then this problem becomes infeasible. So your model has to be changed a little bit where you say meet the demand or less so me meet the demand, if possible or less. If the supply is higher, if the demand is higher than the supply, if it was the other way around, it would be greater than or equal to. But it's important to pay attention here that the model does not end up producing a zero shipment amount. If you have, if you are minimizing the cost and you say meet this demand or less, it means the model may and may choose to ship nothing, and that will give it a value a cost of zero. [00:30:01:20] So we want to avoid this. In this case, because we have enough supply, we can use the equal sign in which we say you need to meet the demand and that will force the model to ship something if you put less than or equal to. And this is a cost minimization, the model will end up not shipping anything because. It will it is the best thing to have is a zero cost. And but so we need something to drive the model to make sure that it ships something. And in this case, if we sell it to equal to the demand, then we force it to ship something. And whenever it ships through the intermediate nodes, it will make sure whatever comes into the node leaves it. Let's see how we implement this in excel and excel. I have the I have the usual set up where I have my decision variables. I have my decision variables and the yellow cells. And these represent the. And this represents the amount shipped from the different ports to the warehouses. Ok. These are my decision variables, so initially I start with zeros. I don't have to have anything. And the same thing here, I just happen to have the optimal solution saved. And for this example. So I don't know what the amounts are going to be. [00:31:26:27] So these are my decision variables to ship from the sources to the intermediate nodes and also the the amount shipped from the intermediate nodes to the final destinations. They are represented by these yellow cells. Here is the total amount of supply available at each node, so it's given to us and the amount shipped out of the summation of whatever is shipped out of the port one and then underneath it is the summation of whatever is shipped out of Port two and so on. And in the second part, I have the demand given to me for each customer in Dallas, St. Louis and Chicago. And the shipped amount are depending on how many the model decide to ship optimally, and these are the summation of the column. So there is nothing new here, we have seen this in the transportation problem, and this is our transportation cost as well, which is the CIJ in our formulation from I 2J, from I to Jay and then from Jay took the new information is here. And what this is, this represents the intermediate nodes. So basically, what this cell has the difference between the total amount shipped into the first intermediate node, which is Norfolk, the node number four and subtracted from the amount shipped from Norfolk to the final destination. In other words, if I go back to my slide over here, if I take Node four, I'm saying I want to find the cells that they represent these flows going into four and subtract from them the the the flows going out, and that difference must be equal to zero. [00:33:28:02] So as if we set the Xigaze from this side equal to the EXI to the X J-K from this side and this way? And this way, I make sure that whatever comes in leaves. In other words, if you move it to the other side, it will be the difference is equal to zero. So in other words, this if you put this set of constraints in a standard format. It will be that the summation of if I do it over here, the summation of Exigé. Uh, from I equal one to three, minus the summation of ex JFK from K equals seven to nine. And I repeat this for four five six. This must be equal to zero and this is what we have in the. And this is what we have in the spreadsheet, so over here, I have the difference between the total amount shipped minus that the total amount shipped out of Norfolk to the minus the total amount, the total amount shipped into Norfolk. So the amount going in minus the amount going out must be equal to zero. I will force these this cell to be equal to zero. The same thing with the cell the total amount shipped into New York, minus the total amount shipped out of New York. [00:35:06:10] Over here must be equal to zero, so this is the set of intermediate constraints. Now let's look at our objective function. Our objective function is now we include both the cost of shipping from the source to the shipping, from the source to the intermediate node, plus the cost of shipping from the intermediate nodes to the final destinations the each term. You see here, you have to some products. The first one is the sum product of shipping from the sources, so you have the cost per unit multiplied by the total amount. You add up all of them, plus the cost of shipping from the intermediate nodes. Per unit multiplied by the total amount that gives me my objective function value. The the demand constraint, I will just make sure whatever is shipped into the final destination is equal to the demand. And the capacity, anything that ships out of the sources. These cells must be less than or equal to the supply. So when you look at, for instance. The amounts the the. The amounts shipped from. From Hamburg, which is the first note I will make sure and solver that this amount must be less than or equal to the supply. So let's look at solver. My objective is this cell that that you see activated. And the problem is the minimization. My decision variables are all of the active cells. For the from sources to intermediate nodes and then from intermediate nodes, final destinations, my constraints are the total amount shipped must be equal to the demand. [00:37:14:07] So this is my demand, and this is my. The total amount shipped and the difference and the capacity constraint over here is the total amount shipped must be less than or equal to the supply. Here's the supply. So this is the amount total amount shipped. Must be equal less than or equal to the supply. And finally, the intermediate constraints for the intermediate nodes is that all of these must be equal to zero where each one of these cells represents the difference between the the flow, the inflows and outflows, the flows coming in minus the flows coming out and that difference between in and out must be equal to zero. In other words, they must be equal under. We make sure that we pick the Simplex Linear programming solver because this is a linear problem and we make sure that we select the unconstrained variables to be non-negative. In other words, the zigs must be greater than or equal to zero. Now, when I had solved. I would observe the message given by solver where all constraints. I found a solution or constraints and optimality conditions are satisfied if I say, OK, that gives me the total cost. Let's inspect that solution a little bit just to make sure that we get sound results. So the demand in Dallas is 60, 45 and 50, and all of this demand has been met, so that's great. [00:38:55:14] The amount shipped 55, 63 37 is less than or equal to the supply. So in the case of Hamburg, we used all of the supply, so they're equal. However, in the case of Marseille, we used only 63 while we have a capacity of 78. So really, we have an excess capacity in Marseille's case and we used all of the capacity in Liverpool. So that constraint also has been met. The intermediate constraints have been met, so it seems that the solution is reasonable. This is how I satisfy the demand I shipped from Hamburg 42 units and to Norfolk and 13 to New York and then from New York, from Norfolk. I take that 42 and I send it to St. Louis. So it's whatever comes into Norfolk leaves into St. Louis and whatever came into New York, which is the 13 units. I will I will ship them to Chicago, but it's not only coming from Hamburg and Hamburg, I got only 13 coming into New York. The remaining 37 units came from Liverpool to New York, and this is why you see all of the New York's output. So New York will be there will be two arrows going into New York and one arrow coming out of it, going to Chicago. It will be interesting if you can just take this output and develop a drover network so that you see where the flows are going and coming out of and. [00:40:32:10] And this way you can understand physically what really happens in terms of these shipments. And over here, I have a snapshot of this solution. So this is the transshipment problem and it's an important problem and more practical and very realistic because in many cases, you have warehouses or distribution centers in between between the sources and the destination. It's probably worth while mentioning that you sometimes may have more than one layer of nodes. So imagine if you have a network like this, you have another set of nodes where you may have something maybe like this as well. You may have three more nodes as well. So these they can be maybe warehouses over here. And then these are distribution centers. And finally, you have retailers. But the same principles apply in the case like this. You need to make sure whatever comes into from the first intermediate node goes going, whatever comes out of the intermediate nodes going out to the distribution center and going from the distribution center to the final nodes must be equal. So anything that goes into this node must leave and anything goes into this node must leave and so on. The principle is the same, so you will have another set of constraints that reflect that the inflow is equal to the outflow on that set of notes.

So let\'s get started!Job allocation Resource allocation Binary variables Integer variables Workload balancing; Transcript: [00:00:02:02] Let's take an application of a distribution problem and this problem, we have a company that sells computers to universities and colleges, and it ships them from three different warehouses. Supply demand transportation costs are given at the beginning of the academic year, of course, and we would like to formulate a mathematical program to solve the problem and find the optimal amounts to be shipped and buy our trucks. So in in this example, these are my distribution warehouses. So they are located in Richmond, Atlanta and Washington, DC. And this is the amount that they can supply, and this table represents the demand points or the points they are, the universities that they have, that they have the demand for these computers. So I have four universities with the following demand levels. So if you notice here, the amount of supply is actually the total amount of supply is less than the amount of demand. This is unbalanced problem. Distribution problem, transportation problem. This is the cost per unit of shipping from Richmond, Atlanta, Washington to to these four universities Texas A&M State and Central ABCDE. So this is a transportation cost. Now the question that we need to address is to formulate this transportation problem, to know what is the best amount. What is the optimal amount to ship from each warehouse to each demand point or to each university? So as a starting point, I have this graph, so the problem can be modeled as a transportation problem. [00:01:55:25] So you see the network here where these are my supplies one to three and this is my. One, two, three four. Or ABCDE, I like to use numbers more than letters where I'm distributing the product, the product, they can go from one to one one to two one to three one to four. The transportation cost is whatever C one one four. So, for instance, from Richmond to attack, the cost is $22 so that we will per unit. So that will be my C one one here and so on for the rest of it. So. I'm trying to find out what is the optimal amount exigé, so if I define Exigé as the amount of sheer amount? To ship. From Source I to demand point, J. Remember that in the the demand here, D.J. is for each. So for, for instance, for tech, it's five twenty. Uh, five, 20, 250, 400, 380 and the supply. Is here. 420, six, 10 and 340. So to use the compact form of formulation, if I define it as the cost. Of shipping. A unit, a computer from I 2J. And if I also define PSI as the capacity or the supply at supply amount at Node I and the as the. Demand at university, J. Demand, R. J. Then I can formulate this problem. By as follows, I can minimize the transportation costs, see which is the summation of SIG, Exigé and J from one to four. [00:04:40:02] So these are the four markets or the four universities, and I is one to three. These are the warehouses. So I will for each node I, I will add up all the costs that are going from node one to all of the four universities, in addition to No. Two to all of the other universities and so on. The constraints that I have first, that the demand must not exceed the supply. It can be equal to the supply, but not. Must, must not exceed the supply. And we also have a. The amount shipped must be less than or equal to the demand as well, so. I cannot exceed my supply and also I need to meet my demand. And that's in general. I want you to look at this data again and notice here that we have to be flexible in how we set up our constraints somewhat. If you look at the amount of supply I have, 1870, the amount of demand is 15:50. If I enforce a constraint that says the demand must be met, this problem is infeasible. So if I want to, if I want to meet as much as possible from the demand, then the total amount shipped into the four universities must be less than or equal to the total demand. So it is deciding on the level of demand that must be included in the whether the demand all must be met or exactly equal less than or greater than. [00:06:23:04] We need to look at the context of a problem and make sure that we set it upright. In this case, I have supply that's less than the demand. So enforcing the demand to be met does not really give me any feasible solution, and therefore we need to set up the constraints such that. The summation of Exigé must be less than or equal to the demand. And this is from I equals one to three. And this goes from J equals one to four. And why is that because I have a note here, Jay, that I would receive from three different sources the products Exigé. So I want to make sure that the whole amount coming from I one I. Two or three is not greater than is less than or equal to the demand at GE. And I repeat this for all. J one, J, two, three and four. Okay. The second constraint that we cannot exceed our supply in this case, I can use all of my supply and I can use all of my supply, which is a 13 70. So I can set up that constraint to be equal to the supply. So my constraint can be written as a summation of Exigé must equal to as I from Jay Equal one to four. And that applies for I equals one, two or three. Again, the idea here is that I is my distribution warehouse and it can ship to any of the four warehouses. [00:08:29:08] So anything going out of I, it has SSI. It has a capacity, certain capacity that I cannot exceed it, in fact. In fact, in this case, I will make sure that I will use all of the capacity because the demand is still higher than the the the supply. So for each of these nodes on the supply side, I will add up the amounts going out of it to to all of their markets and make sure that the submission is equal to PSI for each note. And I repeat this for I equal one, two or three. So one thing to notice here that these signs are very important. Well, the last the last thing that I want to make sure is that I greater than or equal to zero for all I and J. One thing that's very important to pay attention to are these signs. Depending on the type of the problem, depending in the context of a problem, I may make these equal time greater than less than. So typically speaking, we want to meet the demand without exceeding the capacity or the supply. That's typically the case. When we looked at the data here, we said, OK, I have a more demand than supply, so this means that I need to meet as much as possible from the demand. So Exigé would be less than or equal to deejay, and I can use all of my supply in order to accomplish this. [00:10:00:10] If you had to, if you had to actually meet all of the demand, you simply in this setup you don't have. Enough supply to meet the demand and the problem is infeasible. If you said the amount shipped, exigé must be less than or equal to s must be less than or equal to psi. Actually, the model is going to produce nothing. It will produce zero. And the reason for this is that the model, since this is a minimization model, it will have no incentive to actually send anything. If you make the demand exigé is less than or equal to Jay, and Jay is less than or equal to a side. What you're saying is that you can meet the demand or less and you can use the distribution center capacity or less. So the model to its best interest is to give this value zero all over, so to have a value of zero. And since these two constraints are less than or equal to the less than or equal to psi, then it will not ship anything. In other words, the model will not have an incentive to ship anything, and it will produce it will ship zero. That doesn't make a lot of sense. So in this case, since the demand is exceeded, exceeds the supply. We said, OK, you don't have to meet the whole demand, meet part of it as much as possible, but then use all of your supply. [00:11:22:28] We this is why we have equal sign here and demonstrate this with Excel. To show you the how we solve this problem. So in Excel, I have this file set up, so for the first part, initially, I don't know how much I'm going to send from any of these distribution centers. So these are my decision variables. This is just the sum of anything that I ship out of Richmond, out of Atlanta, out of this year and so on. This is the amount of supply given to me available at any of these three locations, and the amounts here is whatever is received into the university, into tech, into A&M, into state and into central. This is the demand that's given to me and this is the total demand. If you sum them up, it will get this 15 50. The unmet demand is simply just the difference between the demand and the amount received, and that will tell you how much is unmet. The what I'm minimizing is the cost. So I have the transportation cost here from IUJ per unit and these are the zigs. So if I take the sum product of these two, that will give me the total transportation costs. So if I take the sum product of this range by this range, it will give me the total cost and I want to minimize this. The constraints are the demand and the. [00:12:52:24] Are the supply, so I want the total amount received to be less than or equal to the demand given here. And I also want the total amount shipped to be exactly equal to the supply. So when I go to solver, my objective function is this green cell minimize. These are my decision variables, the yellow range. And the constraints are that the total amount received submission of Exigé over J1 J 2G 3G for must be less than or equal to the total the amount of demand for J1 j 2g 3G for. And on the other side, the supply side, I have the amount shipped and this amount shipped, which is the submission of anything that's coming out of Richmond, anything that's coming out of Atlanta, anything that's coming out of DC. This total amount shipped must be equal to the supply that's given to me, which is this range right here. And finally, I just assumed that all or select this option for non-negative decision variable values and that options, I just leave it as it is. No, no changes there. And when I had solve. Kingsolver finds a solution and optimal solution, I keep that solution. And that's my total cost. So let's take a look at what happened. First of all, the shipment I shipped from Richmond to A&M and Central and the total amount shipped is 420, which is equal to the supply. I expect these three cells to be exactly equal to this because I have a constraint that forces them to be equal and. [00:14:44:02] The. The amount shipped from Atlanta to tech and to state is given to us here from the sea, we are here. If you look at the demand of each university here, the total demand was met. Also here, the total demand was met here. The total demand was unmet and the amount of shortage was 180. It was expected to see some unmet demand because the supply is less than the demand. This situation is this type of distribution is what would minimize the total transportation costs from these three places to these four universities, and not that in some cases the they like, for instance, in state and central. The shipments are received from two different sources. It's not only one source that can meet the demand or part of the demand. Ok, so that's the solution for the model that we implemented and relatively straightforward. Let's take a look at. Let's take a look at this second part of the problem. But to better meet the demand, the company is considering two strategies first to either to expand its warehouse at Richmond to 600. Right now, it's 420 at a cost equivalent to an additional $6 a unit in shipping. So if they increase that capacity of the warehouse enrichment to 600, that will increase the shipping cost by about $6. So that's one option to meet the demand because I have more demand than the supply. [00:16:29:11] The second option is to purchase a new warehouse in Charlotte that can supply 300 units with shipping cost of $19 to per unit to take $26 to A&M, $22 dollars to state and $16 to central, which one should we select in order to minimize that total transportation costs? And remember, this is totally based on transportation costs, not based on fixed costs like this, the lease or the the cost of building a new warehouse or something like this. So it's totally based on transportation costs. So. So what changes the mother remains pretty much the same, except that if I look at the data. So let's evaluate the first alternative and see what happens. Ok, so let's increase the capacity of Richmond to 600 if I increase the capacity in Richmond to 600. That's partly if I increase the capacity to 600 now. The total amount of capacity is 15:50 and the total demand is 15:50. So in other words, by doing this, I can exactly meet the demand. This means that they I can make this equal sign if I wish. I can make equal this equal sign or I can leave the model, as is. And since this summation of Exigé is equal to is it now is equal to 15 50, meaning I will have to use all of the supply, then this will automatically be met at the level of 15 50. [00:18:06:05] So it's up to you if you want to change the model or not. Let's go back to excel and see how this change will affect our model. So I just changed the supply level from 420 to 600. And I resolved the the problem and I made some changes to the constraints. So in the constraints. In fact, you don't have to make any changes to the constraints. The amount of supply is equal to the amount shift is equal to the supply and that will enforce this constraint to be at the 15:58 level. In other words, even if I change this to equal sign, it will not change anything I will. I will demonstrate that. So when I had solved. And found an optimal solution. What happened is now if you compare the numbers from mostly if we focus our attention here and here, notice here that the cost was just like before plus $6, this is what I have in the title here. So it used to cost. It used to cost $22 to ship to tech. Now it costs $28. And to end M23, it used to cost 17 and so on. The amount that you ship. If you go back to a I ship to end them 250 and 172 central. Now I ship 252 and a month 352 central. Ok, so the solution is actually different. The cost is different. So in part a the cost is 21:9 30 in Part B 29 one 30. [00:19:42:17] So these two numbers, although they look to some degree similar, this one is 21:9 theory and this 129 130, the demand is all met, so the unmet demand is zero. And now the capacity is we have. We are running at a maximum, running at maximum capacity. This is my cost. Now how do I know if this plan is better than having a new warehouse in in Charlotte? So just to remind you, this was the second option to purchase a new warehouse in Charlotte that can supply 300 units with shipping costs as follows. So in this spreadsheet over here, Part B two, the amount of I have a new I have a new warehouse in Charlotte. So this is a new point. And I included it in the I increased my range of decision variables. So now the four to four, not three to four I have, I'm given the amount of supplies just like before. But with the addition of 300 units from Charlotte, the Richmond level is went back to 420, is set back to 420, as it was. And the the supply from Charlotte is 300. Now I have more supply than demand. Ok, so what do I do? What do I do to my model? The the the cost now is included here, and the objective function now was expanded to include Charlotte. So as you can see now, Charlotte is part of the range, and the cost to ship from Charlotte to any of these places is also included in the is also included in the range of the sum product. [00:21:40:10] Now, as far as the the constraints notice that here I have more supply than demand, so we have to be careful if I keep the equation like this. If I keep the equation like this, meaning I will use all of my supply, it means I will be sending some units to some universities that are not needed. So I need to be careful here on about the science, so I need to make sure that the demand is met. If I make sure that the whole demand is met, then I can make the supply, the demand less than or equal or the amount shipped less than or equal to the supply. In other words, when I go to my constraints, so the objective function, the changing cells there they now, they include the changing cells. They include Charlotte as part of the decision variables, but the amount of demand is now exactly met. I don't want to have it less than or equal to because this is an unbalanced problem in the opposite direction, meaning I have more supply than demand. If you force the supply to be equal, it means that it's going to send more than necessary. So if I force the demand to be equal and then I can make the supply to be less than or equal to the amount shipped less than or equal to the supply. [00:23:04:15] If you make this, let's say if you make this equal sign. This problem is infeasible because in other words, you're saying that the 15:50 must be equal to the 1716 70. So if I do this, it will give me an infeasible solution. So I just make sure that the supply since it's the larger amount, the amount shipped is less than or equal to the supply. And when I had solve, it gives me as an optimal solution. So let's take a look at the solution. First of all, the total cost 24 930 compared to this alternative 29 130. So definitely it's more economical to have to set up in Charlotte than to actually expand the warehouse in Richmond. So I would use. So I would use this scenario over the first or, you know, the Richmond scenario and notice here that all of the demand has been met. However, some of the supply there is an excess. Is there an excess? There is a little bit of an excess of capacity at some of these, um, some of these places. So if I want to see how much capacity I have left extra capacity. I simply can't take the difference between the amount shift and the capacity. So how much capacity I have, the supply minus the amount shipped. That tells me there is 90 units of. Extra capacity at Richmond, there is 30 units of extra capacity at Atlanta, and there is no capacity left at Charlotte, although Charlotte was the newest addition to this distribution to warehouse distribution. [00:25:02:25] It's still the additional capacity was left at these places because it turned out to be less expensive to ship out of Charlotte to these places than to ship out of Richmond and Atlanta. So basically the model the model ended up shipping more to central out of Charlotte than other sources, and this way we ended up saving saving some money or by by by utilizing Charlotte's effectively so. So if you want to modify this model, if you want to modify this model for Part B two, for Part B two, so let me. What I will do is to actually copy. These equations, so that we're clear about the mathematical model, I still minimize, except that now this goes to four, because now I have four sources, so this is Part B. Two Scenario two with new distribution, where warehouse and. Warehouse and. In Charlotte. The again, the index here, it's important that actually we are very diligent how we set these models up because they make they change a lot. They change the implementation a lot. So now I have four warehouses and this will also goes to four and the second constraint. Now what I also need to change in this part is that the demand must be met and I cannot exceed the I cannot exceed the. [00:27:11:11] I don't exceed the supply. Ok. I don't exceed the supply. Notice that also, even if you if you said that this is greater than or equal to them, even if you use this, the solution shouldn't really change because the model is trying to find the minimum cost, the minimum cost. So it will meet just the demand and it has no incentive to meet to meet more than the demand, although we have the capacity for it. Let's try this experiment and see if it makes sense. So I'm going to go back to B two scenario and I will. I'll go back to the constraints and suppose that now I say, OK, the demand doesn't have to be exactly equal, even if I say greater than or equal to. Notice how the solution remained the same. The model has no incentive to send more items than necessary because its objective is to minimize the cost and by sending more items, it means higher cost. So it will meet just the first point, which is basically the demand. Exactly the demand. And it will not do any ship any more because there is no real incentive for the model to do so. Ok, so I'll keep it as equal sign and that will be the optimal solution. This is the better solution. This is the better scenario. And I would go with setting up a warehouse in Charlotte.",5036,"[ 0.01160514 -0.00931652 -0.00126583 ... -0.00686587 -0.01575706

We will go over the basics of the problem, the mathematical formulation, and the optimization algorithms used to solve it. By the end of this module, you should have a better understanding of the Assignment Problem Example, its related algorithms, and how to use them. So let\'s get started!Job allocation Resource allocation Binary variables Integer variables Workload balancing; Transcript: [00:00:01:11] In this example, a company manufactures laptops in Europe and Germany, Belgium and Italy and ships them to the United States because of their of some high tariffs between countries. It's sometimes cheaper to ship them partially completed to some locations like Puerto Rico, Mexico and Panama, then complete them there and then finally ship them to their final destination of Texas, Virginia and Ohio. The cost of the completed products and the partially completed products or laptops, plus tariffs and shipment costs from the sources to the destinations or to the intermediate destinations is given as follows. So on these tables, what you see here is the original destination sources Germany, Belgium and Italy. If they ship directly to Texas, Virginia and Ohio, the cost per thousand, the cost per 1000 units, everything is 1000. Here is 2600 versus two Virginia, it's 1300 and so on. These are the. In this costs include the shipping costs, plus the tariffs, plus any cost incurred incurred if I ship from Germany directly to any of these destinations. This is the amount the capacity of the factories at the sources in Germany, Belgium and Italy. And this is the demand in the final destinations. What you see here is the data for the intermediate countries. So for instance, if I ship from Germany to Puerto Rico, it will cost 4300. So this is a partially completed project laptop and to Mexico, it will be unloaded and so on. So as you can notice, it is cheaper to ship to these countries and have them completed there and then from Puerto Rico, Mexico and Panama shipped to the final destination of Texas, Virginia and Ohio. [00:02:00:02] It may not be that easy to figure out what is the best route to take. Should I ship directly or should I ship to intermediate countries and then ship them to the final destination? Basically, we want to determine. The first of all, we want to develop a mathematical model to determine the optimal shipments and also to the final distributors in the US and also the routes, and that the total cost and then implemented in Excel to find these optimal amounts and their routes. So let's start out by maybe a drawing, a simple graph like this that shows the network. So these are my sources of Germany, Belgium and Italy. These are the intermediate countries and these are the final destinations Texas, Virginia and Ohio and the supply at each. The capacity at these countries are in thousands of units, 5.2, six point three and four point five. So a total of 16 capacity and the demand. So this is the. Let's see the capacity at the source I. And the demand at source at the final destination. It is two point one, three point seven and seven point eight. And that gives me a total of thirteen point six. So as you can see, this is an unbalanced problem because I have less demand than they supply. So that makes a difference in our mathematical model. If I define CIJ to be the cost of shipping. [00:03:44:18] The cost of shipping. And tariffs. From. I 2J. Without specifying. This is not just the one to three. This is also includes the four or five six to the final destination of seven eight nine. Also, it includes the one to three to so CIJ can be this one. It can be also this one, depending on which note that you are you are shipping from and which note you're shipping to exigé is the amount. Shipped. From. A certain note, I to a certain destination, J again, I can be either one to three or four or five six to the Final Destination seven eight nine or to the intermediate destination of four five six. So. It costs me to ship from one to four one to five, one to seven, and also it costs me to ship directly. From one to seven, one two, eight, one to nine, so what is missing in this picture is. That I have. Some. Direct. Arrow's going to these location to the final destinations, so that could be. This here or here or here. You. Here or here. So it gets a little bit complicated here, so but you get the idea that I can ship either directly or I can ship through the intermediate, the intermediate nodes. So how do I formulate this model? Let me start with my objective function. I want to minimize the total cost minimize z, which is equal to the summation. From I equals one to three, meaning from the sources one, two, three to four to nine CIJ Exigé. [00:06:14:03] So what this includes this summation this submission includes. The cost of shipping from one to three, starting from one either to four five six seven eight nine, anything is legitimate to be included and if it is not optimal to be included, then it will be dropped by itself. The model will decide for us, this is for our equal one, then four equal to two. It will go to four, five and six, seven, eight and nine. So from two to any of these six nodes, and finally from Node three to any of these six nodes. And this is why we went here from our equal one to three. And then that's the second submission is from four to nine. But now that's not everything, because I also need to include then the flows going from four to seven eight nine five to seven, eight nine and six to seven eight nine. So I need to also include. The double summation of I equals to. Four to six. And J from seven to nine, you can use another index if you want like a K or L. But it shouldn't really matter. Cij. Aig, in other words, the second term will handle the flows going from the intermediate and intermediate nodes here to the final destination seven eight nine. So the first term will handle the flows going to the intermediate and to the final in one term. And the second term will handle the flows going or the cost going from the intermediate nodes to just to the final to the final destination. [00:08:11:20] So that's my objective function. My constraints are typically in problems like this that first, I don't want to exceed the capacity. And second, I need to meet the demand. And because this is a transshipment problem, they I need to make sure that the intermediate nodes will. Anything that goes into the intermediate nodes will end up leaving the intermediate nodes. So let's start with the capacity constraint. So the capacity? The capacity constraint, anything that's going out of for each node, so for I equals one or two or three, I need to make sure. I need to make sure that the amounts that being shipped out of I. To any of the notes from. To all of the notes from J Equal one to nine. Is less than or equal to the capacity I wear where I is the capacity. Maybe I should define it in the first page. I. Is the capacity? At Node. I. And D.J. is the demand, D.J. is the demand. At the destination or A. J. So in this case, here they the for each of the sources, for our equal one or two or three. The summation for the receiving nodes, the amounts going into nodes. Four nodes, four, five six seven eight nine. Must be less than or equal to the capacity, so anything? But let me go back to that picture for a second. Anything that all of these flaws, whether they are going to the intermediate nodes or to the final destination, so I have a six nodes. [00:10:28:00] The summation of all of these flows must not exceed this capacity for Node I four, node one for No. Two for Node three. This is one constraint. The second set of constraints, I guess, because I have constraint. One constraint for one for equal one. Another constraint for equal to another concern for AI equal three for the demand. Similarly, I will need to make sure that the demand is met so 4G equal seven, eight or nine. I need to ensure that the summation of Exigé. For all sources, including the intermediate nodes, must be equal to the G8, so if I look at this at the picture, I will take GE, for instance, equal to seven. So if we go back here, the GE equal to seven to equal to two point one, so the demand at Node seven. Anything that's going into this node must be equal to 2.1. So anything, whether it's coming from the original source or from the intermediate source, it must not exceed it must be exactly equal to 2.1. And the same thing for Node eight and the same thing for Node nine. Since I don't know whether I will be receiving this product from the from the source directly or from the intermediate nodes. I have to include both of them, and whichever is zero will be zero. It will not really add to the amount shipped. [00:11:58:13] So that would be the demand constraint. The finally and but very important, I have to look at these intermediate nodes and say anything that goes into Node four must leave Node four. So whether I have a flow coming from one to four from two to four from three to four and leaving from four to seven four to eight four to nine must be equal to zero. The difference between them must be equal to zero, or they must be. Whatever is coming in must be equal to the amount going out. So to do that, I can simply say so this is the. This is the intermediate, you know, intermediate not constraints. So I have X-1 four plus x two four plus x three four minus x four seven minus x four eight minus x four. Nine is equal to zero. And X one five plus x two. Five plus x three five minus x five seven minus x five eight minus x five. Nine is equal to zero. And finally. X. One six plus x two, six plus x three, six minus x six seven minus x six eight minus x six nine is equal to zero. So this ensures that the the flow coming into the intermediate nodes intermediate nodes is equal to the flow going out of them. And finally, exigé is greater than or equal to zero. To do this model and excel. Let's take a look at our information first, all of the initially I don't have anything shipped because I don't know the values of the optimal, the optimal values for the decision variables. [00:14:06:11] This is what I'm trying to find out. The yellow cells are my decision variables from shipping, from the original sources to the final destinations. And also here the zigs, from the original sources to the intermediate destinations. And finally, this is from the intermediate. To the final destination, the amount shipped in any of these matrices. It's just that some of the raw. And the amounts received is the sum of the column in each for each matrix, the same thing applies here and the same thing applies here. This is the demand that's given to me and this is the supply over here that's given to me. So the demand is in this blue range of cells. And this is the supply in the wide range of cells. And what you they they the a couple of additional things here that we need to include. Also, the total amount shipped represents the amount shipped from the original to the final destination without going through the intermediate nodes, plus the amounts going from the original, let's say, from Germany to any of these to any of these countries. The summation of this. So the amount shipped from the total amount shipped is the summation of the amount shipped directly from the sources to the final destination, plus the amount shipped from the sources to the intermediate destination, which you find right here. Similarly, the amount received is the total amount received in Texas, whether it's coming from the original sources or from the intermediate sources right here. [00:15:57:11] Ok. These cells, the pink cells are the the the inflow minus the outflow for the intermediate nodes. So for instance, if I take if I take this cell, it would take the difference between anything that was. Anything that was shipped. The difference between anything that was received. And Puerto Rico, and then it was shipped out of Puerto Rico. That difference will be must be zero. So these are transshipment flows. I would. Actually make these as Puerto Rico, Mexico and Panama, it makes a little more sense than put them putting them as the as the final destination. So let's say let's take Mexico, for instance, Mexico, which is an old number five. The difference between anything coming up, anything coming in must be minus anything coming out must be equal to zero. So anything that's received in Mexico minus anything that was shipped out of Mexico must be equal to zero and so on. We need to include these in our constraints. Our objective function is the sum product of these three ranges of floats. So if I have if I ship directly from the sources to the destination, I have a cost of IGAs, which you see here by this range over here. The SIGs, if I ship, if I ship from the original countries. Germany, Belgium and Italy to the intermediate countries, Puerto Rico, Mexico and Panama. Then I would multiply. I'll take, I'll add the cost of exigé by SIG right here, the range that you see highlighted in orange. [00:17:56:00] And finally, from the intermediate to the final destination, I also include the sum product of Zig Zag. This corresponds to this summation over here, where this will include the first two ranges going from the original sources I one, two and three, plus the flows from or the cost from the intermediate to the final destination. Going back to my spreadsheet, this is my objective function. Let's see in solver how we include this. The constraints. So that's my cell that I'm minimizing the green cell minimize and the decision variables are whatever you see in yellow and the way I select actually the decision variables using Excel. If you hit the control key, you can select a ranges of cells that are not continuous, so I can select this range and this range and the range above. So these three, I select this range. I hit the control key and then select the second range and select the third range as far as the constraints. You cannot really do that with constraints, so you have to add new constraints if you have multiple ranges that are not continuous. In this case, the demand constraint the orange cells that you see down here must be equal to the demand which is given in the blue cells that you see over here. And this is the demand constraint, the supply constraint is that the total amount shipped, which you see right here in the orange cells must be less than or equal to the amount of supply given to me, which is the white cells right here. [00:19:49:16] And finally, the intermediate constraints which are inflows equal to outflows. The difference between them is zero. I simply select these cells and make them equal to zero. And options are just make sure that I there is really nothing for you to change at this point in the options and just make sure that they unconstrained variables are not negative, meaning its ideas are greater than or equal to zero. And then I had sold. I look at the message says that all constraints and optimality conditions are satisfied, this means that I found a solution, an optimal solution and this solution. This is my total cost to 720. Let's see. Let's see what. Where am I going to be shipping from? From Germany, I would ship directly to Ohio. Five point two, and that's my this is the total amount shipped. That's the. That's the maximum supply that I have out of Germany, it would all it went all to Ohio and the the demand in Ohio, though, is higher at is 7.8. So I still need some additional floors to come from other places. But out of Germany, I went I sent everything out of Germany to Ohio. Then I didn't send anything directly from Belgium. I instead sent some from Belgium, the 6.3. I sent it to Panama. And as you will see from Panama, I will take that amount six point three and and split it in this way, 3.7 and 2.6 between Virginia and Ohio. [00:21:31:26] When you see numbers like this, 4.4 to the power multiplied by 10 to the power minus 16 for all practical purposes, this is zero. So it doesn't really affect the solution. Out of Italy, I shipped 2.1. They went to Texas. I didn't ship directly anything else out of Italy. I didn't ship anything indirectly out of Italy to to the intermediate nodes. So all of the all of the amounts shipped out of Italy went to the two point one went to Texas. The capacity in Italy is 4.5. However, I ship directly to point one. So there is an excess capacity, as you can see in Italy, which is the difference between the 4.5 and 2.1 and then the intermediate nodes. The only node that I really went through is Panama. Where I shipped from Belgium to Panama. So these other nodes are pretty much useless to have even facilities there, so these numbers represent a steady state of shipments from these German. Germany, Belgium and Italy. From Europe to the US. The only intermediate node that I really need is the IS is Panama. The other ones, nothing went through them, so they don't really help that much. So the implication for that is that maybe I don't need facilities over there to ship them to and and have, you know, incur some costs that are not really mentioned in this application, but could potentially be in practice. [00:23:16:03] And that's you see here that this constraint has been satisfied that inflow is equal to outflow. And you can verify this by looking at, for instance, let's take Panama. The What went into Panama at six point three and when it went out of Panama is 3.7 plus 2.6, which is equal to six point three. One thing I want to point out is that you can be asked for a scenario in which in this case, we didn't have a choice of actually storing anything in the intermediate nodes. And the problem can be modified a little bit where you say where we may say that, suppose that we want to ship all of the production from Europe and anything that's excessive more meaning higher than the demand. The difference between the supply and demand. Let's say we can just store it in the intermediate countries for the future. You can pause at this point and think about how you would model that. How can you model this issue? If I say you have to send everything out of the out of Europe to either the intermediate countries or to the final destinations? If the final destination demand is less than the supply, then the remaining the difference will stay in the intermediate countries. Okay. To model this, how would you model this? One way to do it is to think of some dominoes that go from these nodes that I can extend them, that imagine that I have another three nodes, that they don't exist in reality, but you can think of them as warehouses that exist in the intermediate countries. [00:25:00:03] So I can have nodes. We have now all the way up to Node nine I can have here in the intermediate countries. I can have nodes 10, 11 and 12, and I can just treat them as if they are just additional countries. I can I can increase my final destinations by 10, 11, 12 thinking these are they're called dummy nodes, where they are just used to store the amount that excessive amount that will be sent. And you just treat them as an additional three destinations and you expand your model to include these. So anything extra will be stored in these countries and these dummy countries, let's say, and the cost of shipping from the intermediate nodes to the these dummy countries will be possibly zero if there is really no if there is really no transportation costs between the Node four and Node 10, let's say, because it's in the same country or it can be the cost of the warehouse, that would be the cost that may be incurred. So in this case, we would extend the model just a little bit by introducing these three dummy nodes and treating three of them as dummy countries or warehouses in warehouses that I will ship to the extra the extra capacity. So I can leave this as an exercise for you to try to extend this model and see if you get some reasonable results.",4587,"[ 0.01596107 -0.01019922 -0.00520046 ...  0.00122028 -0.01651238

Network flow models are models that are used with problems that can be represented as networks. And in this module, we will learn how to model them and solve them. We specifically will present algorithms and linear programming models to solve problems, including the shortest path problem, minimal spanning three problems, and maximal flow problems. There are other network flow problems or models that they represent other problems, but will not be covered here.

Let's first define what the network is. A network is an arrangement of paths or lines. Branches are sometimes referred to them, where they will be connected at different nodes. And over this network that consists of branches and nodes, one or more items move from one point to another depending on the objective of the problem. The network is drawn as a diagram, and it provides a picture of the system, which enables us to understand better the problem and in many cases, take advantage of well-established network properties to solve the problem. A large number of real-life applications can be modeled this way, and that makes it easy and convenient to solve a problem because, as I mentioned, there are many algorithms out there that are specifically designed for networks. And if you can model your problem as a network, it just makes things easier and you can probably solve them more efficiently.

The components of a network include nodes and arcs mostly, or branches sometimes as we refer to them. The nodes, which are represented by circles, represent junctions or points, or locations. So, the network consists of nodes and branches, and then the nodes that are represented by circles, represent junction points or locations. While the branches or the arcs connect the nodes and represent the flow or over which the items will flow. The values that are on top of the arcs, represent distances or time, or cost. So in a network like this, usually there is a starting point and endpoint. These are the nodes, the circles, and the arcs or the branches or the lines they represent. They represent the flow of items between different locations or between different nodes. This is a general representation. In some cases, we may have special cases with special types of lines or nodes or values, but that's the general representation of a network. And if this represents time, you will see a value over a certain branch or it can represent a distance and you see a value over that over that branch.",710,"[-0.0058875   0.01002837  0.00402966 ... -0.02629749 -0.01644574

By the end ofNon-linearProfit analysisConstrainedOptimizationConstraints; Transcript: [00:00:00:28] We cover here the shortest route problem in this problem, we are required to find the shortest distance between a starting point in a network and the endpoint. So for this example? The starting point is not one, and the endpoint is not seven. And in between, we are trying to find the shortest distance or the shortest path to get from one to seven. So in this network, these nodes, they represent, for instance, cities and the numbers on top of the arcs they represent distances. So if you're planning a trip to go from City one to arrive to City seven and you're looking for the shortest the shortest route, you want to travel from one node to another, such that the the you get to from not one to seven in the shortest distance possible. So to start the algorithm or to start the process, we first start with the initial point or the starting city, which is not one in this case, and we define or we identify the shortest the the set of the set of nodes are connected directly to the starting node and we start with a permanent set that includes just the initial node. And then we look at we enumerate all the branches that are connected to this node and then we list all of the times and we pick the one with the shortest distance or the shortest time. What you see here on the right is the original problem, I keep repeating this so that in any time you need to go back and look at the data, it will be more convenient just to glance at this small diagram. [00:01:52:26] So every step we refine or redefine the permanent set, we add more nodes to it as we progress through the process and as we add more nodes to the shortest to the shortest path. So in this case, I start with node number one and identify all the nodes that are connected to node number one. These are nodes two, three and four, as you see. So I have a branch one, two and one three and one four. Enumerated here and then I will list all the distances or times, whatever, depending on what the what, what these represent in the original problem. So from one to two, the time is 16, from one to four. It's 35 and from one to three, it's nine. And I pick the shortest one. So the shortest one is nine. And that I add that to the permanent set. So now, one and three, they become part of the permanent set. So when I go to the next step, one and three are part of the permanent set, and now I will identify the branches that are connected to the permanent set not only to the original node, but to the permanent set. So anything that's connected to one or anything that's connected to three must be listed. So looking at this, the original diagram, you can see that one two is connected to one. [00:03:19:13] So that's one of three since they are the permanent set at this point. Two will be identified as connected to the permanent set four, as well as six. So. In a branch, they sold nodes to four and six. They're all connected to the permanent set. There are several ways of getting to two, four and six, and we list all the branches that are possible. So we have we can get to two from by going from one to two and going to four will be going. We list the branch one four and one three three. We don't list this branch because it's all three is already part of the permanent set. We only list the branches that are connected to the nodes that are not part of the permanent set, and nodes four and six are connected to two branch three. As well, so so we list them so the branch three, four and branch three six is are also listed and the possible ways of getting to these nodes that are connected to the permanent set. And then we look at the smallest, the time or smallest value. And in this case, one and six one and two one two branch one two has the shortest time. So we select that and we add Node two to become part of their permanent set. What this really means when you see in the in the diagram number in this case 16 for Node two. It means that the shortest way to get to know two is to go from one to two directly. [00:05:10:16] And the shortest way from to get to node three is to go to from one to three from one directly. There are very little options here. You don't have really much of a choice, but in some cases it is possible as you see that you may get to a certain node by going not necessarily directly, but it could be going from one to four and four to two. But this is not the shortest way to do it. If it was the shortest way, then we will take that shortest way. So now going to the next step, the number two became part of the permanent set and now the permanent set consist of one, two and three. There are nodes four or five and six are connected to the permanent set in different ways. So we enumerate all of these ways that connect nodes four or five and six to the permanent set. So if you look at Node one, starting with Node one, four is connected directly to one. Two is connected to four. So I have to four as well and two, five and three four. Three, four and three, six, three six in the original diagram. It's clear here the dark, the dark lines, they represent the shortest connections. So if you take the minimum of all of these distances or times, three four is the shortest one three four, and we identify that the distance is 24. The reason this is 24, not 15 or not 12 is because the way we look at the way we add these numbers are one four. [00:07:03:01] It's 35 because it's clear it is just a direct connection to four now to four to get to four through two. You first has to get you first have to get to two, which is which takes you 16 units and then add the 12 to four and that will add up to twenty eight. So you see here trying to get to five, you first get to two, which is 16 plus 25, that will give you 41 going to four through three. You first need to get to three, which is nine. Add to that the 15 that gives you 24 and then to get to six, it will be nine plus the 22 that gives you 31 and the shortest among all of them is 24. Now we add Node four to the permanent set. There is really it's just a coincidence that the the the permanent state is getting sequential numbers like this, in some cases, you may jump numbers so you may end up going one two three five and then you add four or maybe one two three five six, depending on the numbers. It doesn't have to be sequential in this way. So now the dark lines that represent the permanent set with the shortest routes. And at this point, we have one two three four as part of the permanent set. And we look at the branches that are connected directly to the permanent set, so two five. [00:08:39:14] Three six. Four or five? Um, for seven. And for six. Are all connected directly to the permanent said again, to get the two or five, we saw how we got it last time. Three six, the same thing. We got to three first, which is text nine, then add to it 22. Take, for example, four or five four five. You to get to four. It's 24. We already identified it by this square. So 24, add to it. 14. That gives me the 38 note that we eliminated this branch here once we added four. We eliminated this branch in the original problem, which is 35, because we are not going to ever use this branch to get to Node four. We will always get to Node four by the shortest path, and the shortest path is to get to four by going through three first. So we go to three and then go to four. That will give me 24 this one. The original path, although directly connected one to four, we will never use it because it's much longer than going from one, three and three to four. So all what I need to know if I need to know the shortest path to four is to look at the square that I identified and then add to it the distance to the next node, which is in this case, let's say, to four to five. We added 14 to 24. [00:10:19:27] And that gave us 38 for 27 again, 24 plus 19. I don't have to worry about remembering which path I took to get to for all. What I need to know is the shortest distance to four and four. Six is four, six is 24 plus 17 and that gives us 41. The shortest among all of them is 31, which is 36. So now 96 becomes part of the permanent set. So as you can see here, we didn't include five. We included six because it happened to be the shortest, the shortest path so far. Going continuing this way, we have arcs that connect two to five and we have four to five, as well as four to seven and six to seven. These are the remaining connections to connect the permanent set with the directly with the with the nodes directly connected to it. If again, you calculate the distances. In the same way, you will see that the shortest distance is four to five with 38, so I will select five to become part of the permanent set. And now this is my permanent said. The only note left out of the out of the permanent set is number seven, which is the final destination and the shortest distance to get to seven is 43 because you go through four. You can go through four to seven with four adding 19 to 24. That will give you forty three or you can go to seven through five by going four or five then to seven. [00:12:07:02] But that will add five to seven, will add 38 and eight. That will be 46, which is larger than 43. And finally, six to seven is another option, but that adds 31. Add to it 14 that will give you forty six to seven. Will give you 45. So the shortest distance to seven is 43. And now this is the shortest distance between one to seven. So in this slide, you see a summary of all short distances, I think this is a very convenient way to represent the solution. The optimal solution where you tell anyone who can look at this, who can read this summary is that they would know exactly what is the shortest path from any node to the from starting from node one all the way to Note7. So if you want to get the shortest path to Node four, it will be one three four one three four and with a distance of 24. If you need to get to Node five, the shortest distance is 38. The shortest distance to seven is 43, although you would ask to find the shortest distance to seven, which is really just one value of 43. It is interesting and nice to have this summary that gives the person a perspective on the shortest distance distances across all the networks. So the shortest distance from one to two to one to three, one to four, and so on for all of them. All of the notes and this squares, they represent these these distances, but the the the most important the most important is identifying this square, which is the shortest distance from one to seven going through nodes three, three and four. [00:13:53:22] So to summarize the steps of the shortest route algorithm, you start with the initial node. And you pick the the shortest direct route from the origin, so we look at all of the nodes that are directly connected to that route to that node and we add them to the permanent set in addition to the first node that we selected, which is typically node one. We determined all the nodes are connected, directly connected to the permanent set itself to anything that is connected to any of the nodes in the permanent, said we determine these nodes. And we see which one is the shortest one we identified and that one becomes part of the permanent set. And we repeat these two steps the last two steps, three and four until we are done with all nodes. And that would be. And that would be our optimal solution of the shortest route. Another way to solve this problem is to model it as a linear program where if you define exigé to be zero, if the branch is not selected as part of the shortest route network and one if it is selected, then in this case we can minimize the distance or the time, let's say 16 by x one to plus three five by x 140 plus nine by x one three. [00:15:24:05] And if this happened to be one, then it's going to be part of the shortest network, and if it is zero, it will drop. The same thing applies to the second term. If it is one, then the nine will be part of the shortest route and it would otherwise it would be zero and it will drop and so on for the rest of the terms, as you will see all the way, all the way through. So we don't care at this point whether a certain route is selected or it is not selected. We include everything in the objective function without necessarily trying to figure out which one is going to become part of the shortest route or not. And we need to include some constraints. First, we define that just think of this network as a flow network where a truck or a car or a person is going from Node one to Note7. So if I'm sending a person from Node one or an item. So anything that's going from not one to two or to three or to four must be equal to one, so that card that's going through it has to go through either one two or one four or one three. So the summation of these three will be equal to one because it has to go through one of these three. The rest of the notes in the middle of the in between one and seven, they have to follow the the the law of conserving flow. [00:17:02:19] In other words, whatever comes into an intermediate node must leave that note. So if we take no to anything that's going into Node two, which in this case would be. X one two. Minus whatever is going out will be zero, so in other words, x one two must be equal to X two five plus x two. Four. So if you put it in a standard format, it will be x one to minus x two four minus x two five will be equal to zero. And we apply the same principle to all the other nodes. So if we take Node three, for instance, anything going into Node three, which is X one three minus x three four minus x three six, is equal to zero. And these are the two constraints. Node four has a lot of branches, so it's a little bit longer. But anything going into Node four, which is one, four or two, four or three for all of these. So one four plus two four plus three four minus four or five minus four seven minus four six is equal to zero. And that's why you see this constraint. This way you do the same thing for. Nodes five and six nodes seven. However, must since you sent an entity from this side that to keep the the network balanced, you need to get it from the other side. So as if you if you send the truck here and it goes through the shortest path to seven, then it comes back to one to preserve the the balance of the network. [00:18:39:21] Therefore, we need this for the last node. So for the very first node and for the last node, we set the inputs to the last node, which is seven five seven plus four seven plus six seven must be equal to one or minus one will be zero will be equal to zero. So we just like how we assume that if there is an arrow coming in node one, there is an entity coming in Node one and we say this one coming into node one will be equal to the X one to x one four plus x one three. The same principle will apply here. Anything going into Node seven, which is five seven four seven plus six seven, will be equal to that unit that will leave the network, which is equal to one. Finally, Exigé is a binary variable, however, in this network, you you don't have to define this as a binary variable, even if you define it as a non-negative variable. The values of Exigé will take only values of zero and one of zero or one because the model will have no incentive to give to assign other other values to these variables. To do this in Excel. To do this in Excel, you will get this result. Let's take a look at the the actual file. So in Excel, I define my initially, I don't know what nodes will take, what arcs will take values of zero and what will take value of one. [00:20:14:11] So everything is zero. Initially, these are my decision variables. This is my network. If I. If you look at the again at the network that we are dealing with. You will see that I can go from not one to two, not to one to three and to four. And therefore I have one to two, one to three and one to four, and I will list the distances, which is 69 and 35, going from two to four. Two to four, two to five will be 12 and 25, respectively, right here, going from three can go to three to four or three to six and four can go to four five, four, seven, four, six and five to seven. Finally, six to seven. So all of these are given to us, and my objective is to minimize the distances or the times. In this case, it's the time multiplied by the decision variables, the sum product of the time, by the the times, by the decision variables. What you see here are the constraints that correspond to the constraints down here, so. It swapped locations. So the constraints over here, this constraint, for instance, is the summation of X one plus x two plus x one to plus x one 3+ x one for must be equal to one. So I will set it and solver to equal to one. The intermediate constraints are the inflow minus outflow equal to zero, so x one to stay right here minus x to four, which is right here minus x two five, which is right here, is equal to zero. [00:22:17:01] And so on and so forth. So you have the intermediate constraints up to here. And finally, the last constraint, which is X four seven plus x five seven plus x six seven, is equal to one, I will set it on solver and solver. Basically, I have my objective function right here are minimizing this subject to changing these decision variables. The X, IGAs and. Just make sure that this cell is equal to one, the first constraint and the last constraint is also equal to one and anything in between the range in between is equal to zero. And that's it. You don't even have to include the binary variable in this case, and you just make sure that it is unconstrained variable or non negativity condition is satisfied, and I will make sure that I will use a El-P model. So when you hit Solve solver, we'll find a solution. And what the solution tells me that the shortest route will include X1 three. It will include three four and it will include x 4.7 with a distance of a total distance of forty three. So in this case, you can go back from these decision variables, the values of the decision variables, and you can reconstruct the network. So what this solution is telling me that the shortest path between one to seven is to connect through Node three, so going from one to three. [00:23:56:20] One to three, then three to four, which you see right here has a value of one. And finally from. Four to seven. Which is which will be connected this path. So in other words, it's telling me that the optimal path or the shortest path is going one three three four four seven and the objective function value is four three. And that corresponds to our optimal solution from the algorithmic approach. So there are two ways of solving this problem. You can follow the algorithmic approach by creating the permanent set and then adding more and more nodes to the permanent sentence, finding the shortest path to it. Or you can model it as a linear program, and it will tell you what is the shortest path between one and seven, the the or the source and the final destination? The algorithmic the algorithmic method is a little more intuitive than this method, but this is still a valid approach to solve the problem. In this case, though, in the case of using linear programming, you don't really have to think about which to what to select next. You basically include all of the data and let the solver decide on the values that they need to take one and the value that they need to take to the zero and satisfy the constraints. This is the advantage of this approach. The however, the the the the algorithmic approach could be simpler than setting up a model like this.",4805,"[ 0.00354455  0.003911   -0.00854802 ...  0.00329284 -0.01853442

The Shortest Route Problem - Example 1,8.3,NFM,"Title: The Shortest Route Problem - Example 1; Description: The Shortest Route Problem - Example 1; Transcript: [00:00:00:26] In this example, we are given the time it takes to go from city one to City two then to City three four five six. And this network the different times in terms of number of hours, and we would like to plan a trip where we start at 31 and we make it all the way to city six and the shortest time possible. So these are in this case, represent the numbers on the arcs or on the links between the nodes. They represent the times it takes to travel from one city to another and the nodes they represent the cities. So in this case, this is the shortest route problem and the first iteration and the first iteration we start with with the. The initial city or the initial location you're starting from, and then we add this to a set that we call the permanent set, so now I have city one here. And what you see on the right hand side is the original problem. So if I repeat it just in case I need information from that network and this represents part of the solution. So I start with City one and I evaluate all the distance or the times in this case that it takes to get to any of the cities that are directly connected to city one. So in this case, I can go from one to two or I can go from one to three, or I can go from one to four. [00:01:29:17] The times it takes to go from one to two is two, one to three is four, one to four is three. So the minimum time that takes to go from one to any of these cities is two, which is represented by going from one to two. So I will put this minimum time in a square here indicating that this is the shortest route to or the shortest distance time in this case to city to. So that's the first iteration, and at this point, I can add city to to the permanent set. So if we go to the next iteration. You can see now that two is part of the permanent said, we then look at all the nodes that are connected to this permanent set. So if we can think of this set as a just one permanent set? Okay. And you look at the nodes that are directly connected to it, and these nodes are nodes three, four and five. Not only to not one, but to know to nodes one and not to. So they the links are either one three or one, four, two three and two five. Again, I list all the times and I pick the minimum one. At this point, you could have selected either this one or this one either. Everyone is fine because the next one will be picked up in the next iteration, so you could have selected one four. Or you could have selected two or three to join the permanent set. [00:03:08:11] In this case, I selected node number four just to show you that you don't have to go sequentially and we go by the minimum time or the minimum distance. So I selected number four to join the permanent set and then I go to the next iteration. So now four is part of the permanent set. So now I have one, two and four, so I have this set. I have this as the permanent set one, two and four, and the nodes that are connected to it are nodes three, five and six. If I list all of the times that are that take me to go from any of the permanent set nodes to the rest of the nodes I can go from again. One to three, because three is not yet part of the permanent said I can do, I can do one to one to three, I can do two to five. I can do two to three. I can do four to six. And I also can do four to three. Listing all of these times now, number three is the minimum time, and it becomes part number three will become part of the permanent set. Not how I every time I arrive to the shortest time to get to a certain city, I put it in a square on the network. So now what this tells me, this square tells me that the shortest way to get to City two from City one is going through one to two and the shortest time to go from city or to get to to get to city three is to go from city one then to city two, then to city three. [00:04:54:24] It's not to go directly from one to three because that takes you four hours versus this approach takes you to plus one. It takes me two hours to get City to clearly from this number, plus the time it takes from two to three and that gives me three hours. So now this is number three will be added to the permanent set. So now I have one two three four. Similarly, I will keep going and I look at the one two three four as my permanent said they are connected to two five. The only thing left is two, five, three, six and four six. These are the last three links. So if this is my permanent set this way, the only the only links that are left are this link, this link and this link. Again, I take the minimum, which is two five, and I add number five to the permanent set. And notice how now if I go back to the previous iteration where I had a link between one and three in this. Iteration, I deleted that link because I don't need it. The only way the shortest way to get to City three is to go from one to two, then two to three. [00:06:11:13] In other words, I will never use the path from one to three, so it is unnecessary to have it and they in the network. Every time I want to get to City three from City one, I will go through City two, so I don't need to go directly because it's a longer path for me. And finally, I will add number five to the set, and I selected three six to be my three six to be my shortest time to get to City six. So. I don't if I want to go from one to six in the shortest way, I will have to go from one to two. That will take me two hours, two to three, take me a total of three hours, then three to six take me a total of. Five hours. So in summary. This shows us all the shortest times or shortest routes to the different cities, so this summary tells me that the quickest way to get to City five, let's say from one, is for the shortest time to get to 36 is five and the shortest time to get to City four is three. So it's not. It doesn't only show us the time necessary between one and six. It also shows us the time necessary between one and any other city, the shortest time that I need to get to these cities, and that's represented by the summary.",1462,"[ 0.02033409 -0.00071544  0.00429016 ... -0.01666729 -0.03120117

The Shortest Route Problem - Example 2,8.4,NFM,"Title: The Shortest Route Problem - Example 2; Description: The Shortest Route Problem - Example 2; Transcript: [00:00:00:29] And this problem will require to find the shortest route from City one to City seven, where the numbers on the arcs represent distances. So the city, the distance between City one and City two is 85 miles. The distance between two and five is 31 miles and so on. And we are looking to find what is the the the shortest way to go from City one to City seven. So following the algorithm and the first iteration, we start with the first node, which is node one and we put it in the permanent set. Node one is connected to Node two, three and four. And these are the distances to get to these nodes. The shortest distance is clearly 53, so that's the minimum among all three numbers, and that becomes the shortest distance to get to City three. And I put it in a box here to label that this is the shortest distance to see three now three becomes part of City, three becomes part of the permanent set. So as we go to the next iteration, one and three now are the permanent sets. So we look at all of the other cities that are connected to nodes one and three. So these nodes are two, four, five and seven. And we look at all the possibilities to get from new nodes one to three to the other nodes. So if you look at, for instance, node one, I can go from one to two, I can go from one to four. If you look at Node three, I can go from three to four, three to five or three to seven. [00:01:36:09] The minimum among all of them is 85. So I add node number two to the permanent set because it has the minimum distance and I label it as the minimum distance here. So now the permanent set is one to three. And I will list all of the branches or the arcs that will be connected, that are connected to the permanent set and this case my permanent set, if I highlighted here one, two and three. This is my permanent set and the nodes are connected to node one is connected. Not when it's connected to four. So this is part of the evaluation, one to four, No. Two is connected to five. And that's it, not three is connected to five and to seven and to four. So when I list all of them, it turns out that node number four is has the minimum distance. So I add that to the permanent set. So now I have one, two, three four. And so this becomes my permanent set just to make it easier to visualize what's going on. And the nodes are connected that connected to the permanent set are two five. Three, five, three, seven and four six. Now I want to point something that the the note of five, for instance, in the minimum is 114, which is the distance needed to get to Note five and note that how we calculated this distance, it's no longer connected directly to Node one. So to get to Node five, the shortest way is to go through Node one to two, then two to five. [00:03:33:03] And therefore I add the minimum distance to get to know two, which is 85 plus 31, and that gives me the 114. So I don't list here this link, which is 31. It has to be four before you can get to Node five. You have to get to know two first, which is the shortest distance to No. Two is 85. And then you add to it the distance from two to five. And this is how we came up with 114 and we add Node five to the permanent set, as you see in the following iteration. Again, I have my permanent set one two three four five. And the nodes that are left are six and seven. So the nodes that are in the permanent set connected directly to these nodes are three three, two seven and five to seven and four to six. Again, the way we calculated, for instance, this distance, the 170, if you look at these numbers. Let's take, for instance, way. Let's take, for instance, the 186, which is not five seven. The way we calculated this number is that it took us 114 to get to load five and from five to seven. You add another 72. So that will make it 186 nodes to get to seven through three. You first have to get to Node three, which takes you fifty three miles. Then you add to it 117. And that's the 170. And finally, to get to six through four. [00:05:09:16] You add the 88 plus 137 that gives you the 225. The minimum among all of them is 170, and node number seven becomes part of the permanent set. The only thing left is to to get to node number six. No, No. Six, I can go through for four to six by adding 88 and 137, I get 194. Ok, if I go, if I add, excuse me, if I add 88 and I add to it, add to it 137, you will get 225. Ok. And the other option is to go through Note7, so if I add to 170, I add to a 24, I get the 194. So this 194, you're getting it by going from not one to three to seven then to six, not from one to four to six, because one four six will be 88 plus 137, which gives you to twenty five in summary. This is how you get to the different cities in the shortest way, shortest distance. So this summary shows you that the shortest path to, let's say, City five is 114 and you do this by going from one to three, then from three to five, that's the shortest way. And to get to number seven or or to number six. It is one nine. It takes 194. So and the way you get there is one to three to seven, then to six. One, three, seven, six, there is No. Five here. And that would be that would be the summit. There is no fight in this.",1323,"[ 0.01988251  0.00949869  0.00272311 ... -0.01278822 -0.03585457

Let\'sOptimizationLocationanalysisSupplyFacilitySite selection; Transcript: [00:00:01:00] Let's now go over a problem known as the minimum spanning tree problem and see how we can find the optimal solution for this problem. In this problem, you have a network of nodes and arcs and you are trying to connect all of these nodes through links or arcs such that the total distance or the total amount of length for these arcs is minimized. Some applications that can be modeled with this problem are when you try to connect all these nodes and put TV cables that you're trying to connect different cities or can be pipelines for water or oil. As long as all of the cities in some way or another, they're connected, then this problem is considered the minimum spanning tree problem. And note that this is different than the shortest route problem, the shortest route problem is trying to find the minimum distance between two different nodes, and here we are, trying to connect all the nodes in a way that will minimize the total amount of length for the arcs that connect all of the nodes. So if I take this example where I have seven cities that they are trying to, we're trying to connect them in with a cable, let's say, and minimize the total distance or the total length of cable. [00:01:32:12] I usually would start with any node you can select any node, but the typical solution method starts with Node one, the convention is to start with Node one. Then find the north that's closest to it and select that node and add it to the spanning tree. So in this case, the closest node to it is node three with a length of nine. [00:01:57:18] So we selected that and then we have the spanning-tree now has one and three and one set and now we look to see [00:02:12:10] where the next node, which next node will select so that it has the [00:02:17:00] minimum distance from or the minimum length from either of Node one or three. So the minimum length that connects the new node to the existing nodes in the spanning set. So for this case, I have one in three already selected in the spanning tree set, and now I will add to it Node four because it has the minimum length. [00:02:44:28] Among like the possibilities [00:02:47:11] are nodes one, four, and six that are connected to nodes one and three, and the minimum length that will connect another node, a new node to the existing set of one and three is this 15. The arc with a length of 15 and will add Node four to it. So now Node four becomes part of the set, and we continue in this fashion until we select all the nodes. So since I have one, three, and four now in one set, the closest node is node two, where the length is 12. It's smaller than any other length that connects any of the spanning tree nodes to the unselected nodes. So I have now one, three, and four. And if the remaining nodes are two, five, seven, and six, and the smallest distance or the smallest length is 12. So now [00:03:51:15] city [00:03:51:23] two or node two becomes part of the set, the [00:03:55:19] spanning-tree set. [00:03:56:23] [00:03:57:01] And now that I have one, three, or one, two, three, and four, the next closest thing is to connect Node five. Because it has 14 is the closest thing, closest node to any of these selected nodes. And next is to select node seven, as it has the smallest length that connects it to the spanning tree set. Finally, we add Node six, which has 14 as the smallest distance from the unselected node, which is six in this case, the only node remaining among the other distances 17 and 22, and 14, 14 is the smallest one. [00:04:50:28] Now you add the total lengths for all of the nodes that you are highlighted here in darker blue and will end up being 72. So the total amount of cable that's used to connect all of these nodes is 72, and that's the optimal solution. This problem is known as the minimum spanning tree problem. And again, I want to emphasize how different it is from the shortest route problem in which you try to find the minimum distance between one and seven, for instance. That's a very different problem than trying to connect all the nodes with the minimum total length. [00:05:37:15] So in summary, the algorithm is very simple. You start with any node conventionally node one and you select the closest not to it that's not present in the spanning tree set. And then you keep repeating this set until you select all of the nodes they and they become part of the spanning tree set, and that would be an optimal solution for the minimum spanning tree problem.",1311,"[ 0.01320395  0.00079727 -0.00662202 ...  0.00641153 -0.0269692

Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm Example,8.6,NFM,"Title: Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm Example; Description: Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm Example; Transcript: [00:00:01:08] Let's take an exercise on the minimum spanning tree algorithm. In this problem, we are asked to find the minimum spanning tree for this network, and this network can be an application of connecting different cities with the active cable or with pipes or with any thing in which your objective is to connect the cities in any way, as long as they are connected to each other through any other node. So as long as a node is connected to the rest of the nodes, then then that objective is achieved for that particular node and we start by conventionally, by selecting Node one, and we added to the the the spanning tree. So if I take node number one, I look for the shortest or the, yeah for the shortest link from any of the other nodes that are connected to Node one. In this case, I have a choice of Node two, three or four and clearly the shortest length is if I connect one to three with a 53. So now I connect three to one and one and three they become part of their spanning tree. And I now look for additional nodes that are connected to the spanning tree to both one, to either one or three. [00:01:31:11] So as I look for more nodes connected to one or three, I have the choice of adding Node five or Node seven or Node four to the to the network or Node two because Node two is connected to one. So anything that is connected to nodes, one or three is considered and looking at all of their choices, the shortest length is if I connect Node five with three and that the length would be 61, so I add Node five to the network. So now five is included and the the next step is to look for the next shortest length that's connected to the spanning tree. Keep in mind that now the spanning tree includes one, three and five. The next shortest one would be connecting Node two with the length of 31. And now my spanning network, my spanning tree is one, three, five and two. [00:02:37:19] What is left? I have seven, six and four are left. So if you look at the choices, you can connect five to seven, you can connect three to seven, you can connect four to three. You cannot connect six yet. So looking at all of these choices, connecting three to four is the shortest one, and that will be 65. And now the remaining nodes are six and seven. So my choices are I can do five, connect five to seven, I can connect three to seven, I can connect six to four, and the shortest one is seventy-two by connecting five to seven. [00:03:18:12] And the only node left that's not connected is Node six, and the closest thing is to connect it via Node seven. So the total, so that 24 is added to the network and now I add up all of these distances or all of these lengths for a cable or for a pipe or for whatever the application is. It turns out to be three or six, and that would be the optimal solution for this minimum spanning tree. [00:03:45:17] So in this case, as long as a node has is connected in one way or another to this network, then it can, the material can flow from any node to the other, so it can go both ways. So if I let's say I need a signal, TV signal to go from one to six. I can always do, I can always go through this path and then there will be, there will be a flow of signal in from between one and six. So as long as I have the nodes connected in one way or another to the network, then I, I have accomplished my objective.",802,"[-0.0148328  -0.00247104  0.01120643 ... -0.0181188  -0.02251758

Should a certain type of units from one source to a final destination like in this example, from one to six across the network so that we maximize the amount shipped from one to six. However, we have a constraint on each arc or of a branch and that such that it has a maximum capacity so that the maximum capacity to ship from one to two is six and the maximum capacity to ship from one to four is four, from four to six is five and so on. So in this example, suppose that we want to ship certain type of products, or this can represent a transportation network where these are the number of cars in hundreds or thousands that they can go through a network. Or it can be the number of trucks in a transportation network. It can be pipes that they carry fluids, gas or water or oil, whatever it is, and they have a certain amount or or a maximum capacity on each arc. So our objective is to ship as much as possible from in this example, from Omaha to St. Louis. And the flow can go through the through the network through various links on the network until it gets to the final destination. So the question is, how much do I shape from or allocate from each node to the next node know that a capacity of zero, it means that the products they cannot flow in the opposite direction. [00:01:56:14] It will be a directed graph in which the products will flow from one to two. Only in this case, however, going from. That doesn't necessarily have to be the case all the time. In some cases, there could be a bi directional flow where the product can flow backwards from one node to another. But this graph in particular, it's a directed graph in which the flow just goes in this direction. Ok, so let's see how we can use an algorithm maximum flow algorithm to find a solution optimal solution to this problem. First, we arbitrarily choose a path through the network, from the origin to the destination. So let's say that we choose one, then two, then five, then six. So we have this highlighted path to ship the products across and we look at the capacity of and we try to ship as much as possible through this through this path. We look at the the capacity of each note of each arc. So in this case, one maximum can ship the two six units from six to five. We can maximum ship eight from five to six. So one to two six, two to five, eight and five to six four. So now we are limited, although we can ship six. [00:03:29:00] From here, we can ship eight. From here, we really limited by the weakest link or by the smallest capacity on that path, which is for the capacity from five to six. So the maximum I can ship from one to six using this path is four units. And therefore, I subtract that amount. I ship that amount through. So I will send four units which you see in the square. I'll ship this amount through and I will subtract it from the available capacity. So the maximum capacity is six becomes now two and I ship for which you see in the square here. Then between two and five, I will subtract another four and between five and six I will subtract four. So now five to six is maxed out. I cannot really ship anymore on five to six, which is four. Notice also that another important step is to subtract in the opposite in to to add in the opposite direction, the same amount that we subtracted in the forward direction. So in the forward direction going forward, I added, I subtracted four from the maximum capacity. So I ended up with two here, with four here and with zero. And with zero here now, I need to add that amount in the opposite direction, so in the opposite direction, the original flow, it had zero. So now I add four, here I add four, here I add four here. [00:04:58:07] Although this may sound a little counterintuitive, it is the means used in this approach to compute the net flow along a certain branch. So by this, we mean we have to conserve the the flow. And this is how I actually, uh, I can calculate. I can think about a net flow. So if I have if I have a flow going this way for units, and let's suppose that we have a flow going backwards with one unit, it means that I have a net flow of. Three, which will be four minus three, so the maximum I can send is going to be the difference between these two flows. It's just a to ensure that the network is balanced and the inflow is equal to our flow. It's important that we do this step. The other thing to note is, and I didn't mention in the beginning is. You have to assume that certain amount will come into the network and a certain amount will exit, this amount needs to be balanced as well. So when I added this subtracted this far from the maximum capacity, it means that as if I sent through the network for units or for trucks, for cars, whatever the whatever the product is. So. I'm I'm going to send in these four units, and I'm going to get out of that network for units so that this is the calculation for this path. [00:06:35:02] We do the same thing with other other possible paths, so we will reconstitute the branch flow in for another for another path. So another path would be one for six and the maximum capacity for one for is four four four six is five. And so the maximum I can send through is four, because that's the this branch will take only four. I cannot send five over this branch. Therefore, I will subtract four from the maximum capacity, which is four, so I will end up with zero. So now the capacity on one four is zero and I can send the amount of force across this link and from four to six will also go. Although I have a capacity of five, I will send only four because that's the maximum I can send from one to four. So I subtract that four from the five. Don't forget to add the four back on the opposite direction, so the zero will be four and the zero over here would be four. And now I add another four to the output. So now in the previous iteration, I sent four and I got out of the network four, and now I send another four. So a total of eight and I get eight. I can then take another path, which is one three six. One, three, six and the maximum capacity on one three is. [00:08:09:13] Seven. And the maximum capacity on six is six, so the maximum I can send from one three six is six, I cannot send seven because if I send the seven here they, I have one unit that will get stuck. It won't be, it won't be able to go through. So I will subtract six from the maximum capacity on this branch and subtract six. Here you end up with zero. And I add this to the six that I subtracted in the opposite direction. So I have now six in added in the opposite direction here and six added in the opposite direction here. So now the maximum capacity I can send is 14. I do have another possibility which is going through, let's say, branch one three, four, six or so the the branches. I took one two five six one four six and finally one three six. Why can't I do one three four six? You can pause for a second and see if that's a that's a possibility. The answer is I can't because I still have left one unit of capacity left between one and three. I can send that unit through three to four and then finally four to six. I still have this capacity of one. So if we go to the next slide, you see that I use that capacity. So now I ended up with zero here and subtract this one from the maximum capacity here, which is two and then subtract one from this one. [00:09:56:10] I end up with zero. So now I can send another unit, which is which makes the total amount. 15. Can I send a unit from one to two then to four then to six? In principle, I should be able to. However, if you look at the capacity here on this link, it is zero, so basically I can't send any more units from four to six. So anything that I send from one to two to to four will get stuck here and won't be able to make it to six. If you look at all the branches or all the arcs that are leading to six, they all have maximum capacity of zero. At this point, you know that you are done because you cannot, even if you have more capacity in other network links or arcs. You cannot make them get through to six because all of the links leading to all of the links leading to six there all have capacity of zero, which means that I exhausted all the capacity that I have, and that would be the optimal solution. So a summary of this. Of this method is, for this example, it's shown here I sent for. Units across this path, one, two, five six, I sent another four units from one to four, then four to six. [00:11:19:07] And finally, I sent one unit. I sent seven units this way because they consist of six units going to six, three to six and one unit going to force them to six. So I sent one along one, three, four, six and six units along one three six. So that's the my total amount that I can send through is 15. So in summary, I basically I arbitrarily select any path you can start with any path, although sometimes starting with one path over the other may be faster because it will. You may reduce the number of iterations, but this algorithm is fast anyway. And once you select a certain path from origin to destination, we adjust the capacities by using the maximum allowable capacity on the link that has the minimum amount along this path, because that will be my bottleneck on that path. I subtract this amount from all the capacities along that link, and then I will pick another path and add and do the same thing and keep track of how much I'm sending through the network until there are no more paths with available. Our floor capacity and this will give us the optimal solution of the maximum amount that I can send through a network. We can also take an integer programming approach to solve this problem, so if I define for a certain network exec to be the flow from Node II to Node J or the flow along the branch IG and define that as an integer, if I take an example like this one. [00:13:10:21] The amount of flow going out of not one to two. They will be represented by X one two. And if I can just imagine that whatever comes out of Node six, the output that comes out of Node six, if it feeds back into Node one, this output will be X6 one. So if I'm trying to maximize the output out of this network and to keep the network balanced, I connect it back to Node one, so it's as if it's a continuous loop. If I maximize this output, it means that the model will try to push as much as possible from node one all the way to Node six and get the maximum amount in six one x six one and the constraints the first set of constraints that you see. Here they represent the usual inflow is equal to outflow. So, for instance, the amount going into the amount going into Node one, which is X6 one minus what's coming out of Node one, which is x one to minus x one for minus x one three must be equal to zero. So the difference between inflow and outflow is equal to zero, which is the same as saying inflow is equal to outflow and that you do the same thing for the rest of the node. [00:14:35:27] So for instance, if we take Node two, what's coming into two is x one two and what's going out is X two five and X to four. So X one two minus what's going out x two four and X two five x two four and X to five will be equal to zero. So we do this for all of the nodes to make sure anything that goes in a certain node must must leave that node that will make sure that they balance the the the nodes themselves are balanced in terms of inflow and outflow. But we also need for this problem another set of constraints that you see here that ensures that they we don't exceed the capacity along a certain branch. So I want to make sure that I don't send more than six units from one to two. So x one two must be less than or equal to six x two five. Must be less than or equal to eight x one three is less than or equal to seven and so on. So I have that capacity constraints included as a set of constraints, and of course, the last one X6 one must be less than or equal to 17. And the reason I get 17 is because the maximum input here is six plus four plus seven. [00:16:01:22] So what comes out of Node 16 cannot exceed what's going into Node one? What's going out of Node six? I mean, cannot be more than what's going out of Node one. So it is less than or equal to 17, I can now take this model implemented in Excel. And get the optimal solution for the problem. So to do this in Excel. The first thing is that I list the notes and define the network in the way that you see on the on the this in this picture. So for instance, not one is connected to not two and they initially, I don't know how much the optimal amount is. So everything here is zero initially. And so that represents the actual amount that will flow from one to two. But the maximum capacity is six. And one is connected also to three with a maximum capacity of seven. One is connected to four with a maximum capacity of four and so on. So as you can see from these two columns, I can construct the network that you see in this graph. Okay. And in this case, my objective function is really just the last cell. So I point in this cell just to the last cell, which is the X6 one. So technically, you don't really need this green cell, you can select this last cell as your objective function, but to make things just clear. [00:17:47:00] This is my objective function, which is basically the same as this one as this. So I want to maximize the sell the the every I need a constraint that will make sure that the capacity and not the capacity, the the inflow is equal to our. So what you see here in this in these cells is basically what's coming out of an end to node one is equal to what's coming out of node one. So the difference is zero. So this way in this formula, I take the inputs to one the output, the input to one which is right here. They sell six one minus the what's going out of node one, which are these cells must be equal to zero in solver. I will set these to zero and the same thing for the rest of the node. I also need constraints that will define for me the capacity, so I would just add a constraint that says everything on these cells must be less than or equal to the capacity. So to see this in solver? I select my objective function to be the last six one, which is really it's the same one as the green cell here. I maximize this input output and the the decision variables are here and my constraints are that these decision variables must be integers and the capacity. It cannot be exceeded, so the decision variables here must be less than or equal to this range, the active range over here. [00:19:32:26] And finally, the inflow is equal to our flow, which is this one. It means that the difference between inflow and outflows equal to zero. And I make sure that this objective, this option is not selected because because I have integer constraint that I need to be satisfied. And finally, the solver is a linear solver simplex Linear programming. So when I hit Solve. Solver gives me an optimal solution, and I'm getting a total of 15. The maximum is 15. And these are the these are the. The flaws, the values, so from one to two, I can send four units from one to two, from one to three, I can send from one to three, I can send seven from one to four, I can send four and so on. So these are the optimal values. And eventually, you can add these values on the network that you constructed and you put it in squares, as you can see in the slide. So over here, I just added these values over the arcs, and that represents the maximum values that you can send along each arc. So this is just another approach on how you can solve a maximum flow problem. This is an integer programming approach compared to the previous approach, which was more of an algorithmic approach. You go through a sequence of steps and you find these maximum values.",3922,"[-0.00080583 -0.0077253  -0.01131229 ... -0.01173742 -0.01838662

Maximal Flow Example,8.8,NFM,"Title: Maximal Flow Example; Description: Maximal Flow Example; Transcript: [00:00:00:10] In this exercise, we have a network on which products can flow, and we have the maximum capacities on each arc. So the maximum capacity from one to two is 10 units, while the maximum capacity from two to one is four units, and the maximum capacity from one to three, for instance, is 15. And in the reverse direction, its maximum one and so on, so forth. Whenever you see a zero, it means that it's a one-way direction. And we would like to maximize the amount that I ship from Node one to Node seven across the network. And we start out by identifying any arbitrary path from one to seven. So in this case, I selected one, two, and seven. Then I look at this path at the bottleneck in this path, which is the maximum I can send from one to two, I can send a maximum of 10, but from two to seven I can maximum send seven. So then constrained by the amount I can send from two to seven, which is seven. So I will send that maximum amount, so nothing is left in this capacity, so it will be zero. And I will subtract seven from this capacity. So I still have three units to send from one to two that I can potentially send to two and then I can send them in some other path other than going from two to seven. So the capacity left from one to two is three. [00:01:35:15] Keep in mind that you have to go in the opposite direction and add the capacity that you subtracted. So in case of going back from seven to two, I had a capacity of zero. So it will become seven and then going from two to one, I will add seven to the capacity of four, so that makes it 11. And I'm done with this path, so the maximum I can send is seven through this path. And then the next step is to take another path, an arbitrary path, which is, in this case, one three five, then seven. And I again look at the maximum capacities and pick the minimum, the minimum capacity of all of them, because that will be my bottleneck. So the maximum I can send from one to three is 15. And from three to five is 12. From five to seven is 10. So the bottleneck here is the 10. So I will take it, I will send 10 units across the network. And if I subtract the 10 from this one, I will be left with zero. Subtract 10 from the 12, I will be left with two. Subtract 10 from the 15, I will be left with five. [00:02:53:01] So nothing can go through to seven via the 5-7 link at this point. And again, not to forget to add in the opposite direction the capacity that I subtracted. So the zero becomes a 10 and the five becomes a 15 and the one becomes 11. And now I add 10 to the amount that I got out of the network. Seven, initially from the first path one to seven and now I have 10 from one, three, five, seven. [00:03:30:20] Finally, I will have a third path, which is one, four, six, seven. And the maximum capacity is in this case that I can send through is five, because this is the bottleneck in this path. So I take that capacity, I subtract five from the 18, from five, from 14, and that will add another five to the 17 giving me 22. I go in the opposite direction and add five to this one. Add five to this one. Add five to this one. And if you now look at any additional paths that I can use, I can still send, I have three units that I can send from one to two. I can send them via two to three, and then I can send some from three to five, I can send two units. But, the capacity over here is zero, so I cannot really utilize this additional capacity of two units because I will end up not getting through to seven. If you look at an alternative path where you can go from one to three, then three to five, five to four, then four to six. At this point, you see that the capacity from four to six is zero, so nothing can get through to six. [00:04:57:22] The only way from six to seven is through this link. So basically nothing can get through. So even if you explore any other possibility, as you can see anything that's going to seven, in this case, from two to seven, it has a capacity of zero. From five to seven, it has a capacity of zero. From six to seven, I have a capacity of nine, but the only way to get to six is through this link and this link has a capacity of zero. In other words, I cannot get through to it. [00:05:30:22] So the final summary, it's always good to provide a summary because the graph becomes messy, where you show the capacities that you can send from each node to the final node. So I can send, I will send seven from one to two and then that seven will go from two to seven. And then you send 10 this way, 10 this way, 10 this way. So it's the same 10 going through to seven and here the five goes through one, four, six, seven. The zeros that you see are just a way capacity that I will send from, let's say, two to five or from four to five. And that would be a summary of my solution with the maximum amount of 22.",1217,"[ 0.00090447 -0.00963889  0.00936821 ... -0.01506571 -0.01441872

We've been assuming all along that a lot of the functions and constraints that we used are linear by nature, but in some cases that may not be the case. In a simple function like maximizing profit for a certain company where you have, you're selling a certain product and you have a certain amount of fixed costs and a certain amount of variable cost, and you sell a certain amount of that product, which is the volume. In this case, the profit would be the difference between the revenue, VP would be the volume multiplied by the price minus any fixed cost minus the variable cost, which is the volume multiplied by the cost per unit that you produce. That will give you the profit, but with this type of function, we're assuming that it's linear because there is no relationship between the price and the volume. In other words, regardless of how much I price a certain item or a certain product, the demand or the volume doesn't get affected by that price. In reality, this may not be the case where the price and the volume could be dependent. In other words, as you increase the price, the demand for a certain product may decline. That's the more realistic assumption. [00:01:34:13] So for instance, in this example, if I say, I relax this assumption of independency and I say there is a relationship between the price and the volume whereas the price increases, the volume declines in a linear way. So even if the relationship is linear between the price and the volume, the whole function becomes non-linear. So in this case, if the volume is equal to 1500 minus 24.6 multiplied by the price as the price increases, that volume will start to decline at a rate of 24.6, and assume that this is given to us. So at a price of 60.98, there will be no sales, there will be a volume that will be zero because you increase the price so much that no one wants to buy it. [00:02:26:05] If I take this volume equation and plug it back into the profit equation, so if I replace V by this equation right here 1500 minus 24.6, then I will be multiplying P by P that's included in the V function or in this function. [00:02:48:19] So I have a P here, if I plug it in this equation, then I will be having a quadratic term with respect to P. And minus the fixed cost, minus the volume by the variable cost, no change here. So if I have a fixed cost of $10000 for rent or a lease and then the variable cost is $8 a unit, let's say for a product like jeans, maybe if I'm selling jeans. The profit is going to be, once you plug in the volume equation here and you simplify the term, you will end up with this equation for the profit. So you plug in V here and here. So you plug in this V in this equation here and here, and that will give you this equation. As you can see, there is a quadratic term. And with respect to P and this makes the problem non-linear or this function non-linear. If you plot this function against the price, so if I have certain values for the price and then calculate the profit for these, the function would look something like this. This is the function that would be getting and clearly, this is a nonlinear objective function. [00:04:07:13] Where is the maximum profit? For this case, the problem may not be that difficult to solve. If I look at this curve within this, within this range, the optimal price is right here, which is the maximum point, the highest point on the curve. You can easily find this point by finding the first derivative for this objective function and setting it equal to zero because the first derivative represents the slope. The slope for the horizontal line, so the slope over here is a horizontal line and the slope for this horizontal line is equal to zero. So you can find the first derivative and set it equal to zero. [00:04:55:03] This is explained over here where I take the function, I find the first derivative with respect to P, and that would be 1696.8 minus 2 by 24.6, which gives me 49.2 P and a derivative for a constant is zero. If I said this to equal to zero because the tangent here is a horizontal line and the slope for a horizontal line is zero, the price would be 34.49. So this maximum point of profit corresponds to the price of 34.49. So in order to maximize your profit, if the relationship between volume and prices is given in this example, the best price for this product is $34 and almost 50 cents. The volume will be 651, and the profit will be $7259.45. That would be the maximum, the maximum profit. Of course, this is a simple function, and we could find the value of the optimal solution using calculus-based math. However, in most realistic problems, they can be the functions and the problem itself can be much more complicated than this. [00:06:21:07] So in this case, we didn't have any constraints, these are unconstrained nonlinear problems. But in many cases, if a nonlinear problem contains one or more constraints, then it becomes a constraint optimization model or a nonlinear programming model. So that was a nonlinear problem, but if I add constraints, it becomes a non-linear programming model or a constraint optimization model. The non- linear programming model has the same format, just like a linear programming model where you have an objective function. You're trying to minimize or maximize and are subject to a set of constraints. If I have nonlinearity in the objective function and or the constraints, so if I have nonlinearity in the objective only or if I have nonlinearity in the constraints, or if I have nonlinearity in either one of them or both of them, then the problem is nonlinear. Solutions for such problems are much more complex, and they don't necessarily guarantee finding optimal solutions. [00:07:32:01] So if I add, if I take this example that I had just discussed, which is a simple nonlinear function, and suppose that I add a constraint to the problem where I say I don't want the price to be more than $20. So the P must be less than or equal to 20. If you draw this linear constraint, which is just a straight line over here, then the optimal solution is no longer this point over here, which corresponds to $34. The optimal solution is now point A because that's the maximum price you can get for a pair of jeans. So, in this case, the optimal solution happened to be on the boundary of the constraint and the intersection with the objective function. [00:08:24:11] So in this case, we added a constraint and it happened to be on the boundary. However, if that constraint changes a little bit, so if the constraint was P would be less than or equal to 40. In other words, if I say I don't want the price to be more than $40, then the solution doesn't really get affected because the optimal solution is $34. Adding this constraint is a non-binding constraint that doesn't do anything to the model or to the solution. However, we don't know that for most problems beforehand, it's easy to see this in the graph. What we noticed here is that the optimal solution is no longer on the boundary. So in the previous example, when we added a constraint, the optimal solution happened to be on the boundary of the feasible region. So this is the feasible region and just the constraint, the optimal solution will fall here on the boundary of this feasible region. [00:09:28:05] And in some cases, though, that optimization may not be on the boundary. So Point B is not the ultimate solution Point C is the ultimate solution. Therefore it is more difficult to find that optimal solution because now I have to search this whole surface. This is where the difficulty comes from. I don't know, in linear programming, I knew that the solution would be on the boundary. I knew that the optimal solution will be on the corner points, but in non-linear programming, that's not necessarily the case, and I need to look in many, many places. [00:10:09:07] So as a summary, unlike linear programming, although both approaches look similar or both models would look similar, linear programming and non-linear programming. Unlike linear programming solutions, the solution is often not on the boundary of the feasible solution space, and I'll have to look in many places, therefore the search is much more difficult. I cannot simply look at points in the solution space on the boundary, but I have to consider many other points on the surface of the objective function. This greatly complicates the method because now I have to do a lot more search than just the boundary area and the solution techniques for that are complex. In this course, we focus on modeling these problems and solving them with existing nonlinear solvers. For such problems as we will see, we will not get into the methods of the optimization of the nonlinear programming itself.",2191,"[-0.00173635  0.01161729 -0.00685999 ... -0.00931749  0.00781933

A company that produces two products, X1 and X1, and one, we want to decide the optimal amount of both products to produce, given that the profit we make from producing a unit of one is four dollars and the profit we make per unit of X2 is is five dollars. And suppose that the labor hours to produce all units is 40 hours. And it takes an hour to produce one unit of X one and two hours to produce and unit of X two. This is a typical example of a product mix problems. And it is typically we assume that the profit per unit remains constant. In other words, the objective function would be the profit per unit of x one multiplied by the number of units we produce, plus the profit per unit of X two multiplied by the number of units we produce from X two. In reality, this assumption of unlimited or having the profit per unit not affected by the amount we sell is not very realistic because in reality, the more we sell, the less profit per unit we make. So for instance, if we sell one unit of x one, we make. Let's say it's three point nine dollars, but if we sell two units, we make seven point sixty two by by three point eight by something less than the profit per unit if we sell only one unit. So that makes it three point eight dollars per unit. So in other words, if I sell lots of products from a certain product, it is expected that I make less profit per unit, although the total profit will be more, but the profit per unit will typically be, yes, less similar to when you go and buy large amounts of certain products, you would expect that you you pay less per unit of that product. [00:02:17:29] A way to model this can be reflected here. So if I want to, if I define the function that relates the number of units that I sell with the profit, it can be something like this for minus 0.1 by the units I produce, multiplied by the units I produce from X one and four x to five minus zero point two x two by multiplied by X two. These are just examples of potential coefficients that I can use to reflect reality. So in this case, if, for instance, I want to formulate the mathematical program, I will take the profit per unit of four dollars minus the amount I sell, multiplied by 0.1 and multiply. So that becomes the price. That becomes the profit per unit that I sell, but it declines as I produce, I sell more of X1 and the same concept for X2. So if you have, let's say if you're selling, if you sell one unit, you will make three point nine dollars per unit. Then you multiply it by the number of units that will give you the total profit for X1. If I sell 10 units, it will be four minus one, so three dollars a unit multiplied by the 10 units. [00:03:52:13] Then I would be making thirty dollars for selling 10 units of X1. So the more I sell, the less profit per unit I make. And so that can reflect the more realistic situation for selling products of X1 and X2. However, the this objective function is nonlinear because I will multiply x one by x one, I will end up with X1 squared. And the same thing here X2 by X2, I end up with X2 squared. The constraints are linear, so x one plus two x two equals to 40. And that is the labor constraint where it takes me one hour to produce a unit of x one and two hours to produce a unit of X to the total amount of hours that I must spend is 40. And the X1 and X2 must be in a negative. If I. Take this problem and modulating Excel. I'll get this optimal solution. Let me demonstrate how we can set up this problem in Excel. In this problem, I have here the amounts that I will sell from X1 and X2, and this is the profit per unit equation. So the profit per unit equation, as you can see here, is four minus zero point one by the number of units. And the same thing for X2, it will be five minus point two multiplied by the number of X2 units. And my objective function is the green cell, where I have the same product of the profit per unit by the amount that I will sell. [00:05:40:19] So the objective function here is non-linear because I will first multiply in calculating the profit per unit. I will multiply by x one and then I multiply again. When I take the same product, I will end up multiplying this sell the five by C five and that will create non linearity in my model. The labor constraint is simple, it is the X1 Plus two by X2 and must be equal to 40, as I will set it up in solver. This is here. What you see is the mathematical formulation so unsolvable. I have my objective function that I want to maximize here. The Greens help maximize subject to change, subject to the changing the decision variables that are in yellow X1 and X2 and the constraint the left hand side is equal to the right hand side of 40. Notice here that I selected this to make unconstrained variables not negative, which means X1 and X2 is greater than or equal to zero. And most important is to notice which solver to use in this case, because I know that the problem is not linear, I will use the nonlinear solver. If you use the linear solver, it will give you an error. So let's go ahead and try to solve it as a linear problem. And I had solve it says the linearity condition required are not satisfied, so I will go back again and use the nonlinear solver and their options. [00:07:25:14] There is really nothing. I just can leave the default and there is nothing that I need to need to check here for all four of the methods for the nonlinear solver. Also, I can leave this as a at the default. There is nothing much that I need to change and when I had solved. It's important to notice what message I get from silver here, it says all constraints and optimality conditions are satisfied. It means that it's confident that it found the optimal solution. And I can keep the solution, and that would be my optimal solution for this problem. And the profit will be seventy point forty two. This is a nonlinear problem. We didn't get into the how the solver solves the problem. We want, though, to make sure we we understand that when you're dealing with non-linear problems, sometimes it is more difficult to find solutions than linear problems. Most of the time it is more difficult and you have to be aware of that when you model and solve the problem. If I produce a sensitivity report when when Excel gives me the solution, I'll get a report that's different from the linear problems or the linear solution or sensitivity report. In this case, it will give me the answer or the final values for the X1 and X2. And also, it will give me the constraints. It will give me the. The final value for the right hand side of the street, and this is a new a new factor that it also produces Excel produces when you solve the problem, the nonlinear problem it is called the Lagrangian multiplier, and the Lagrange multiplier is simply the value of one additional hour of labor. [00:09:21:06] So the value of one additional resource, it is equivalent to the shadow price in linear programming problems. So in non-linear programming, it's called the Lagrange multiplier. So if I want to know the value of adding one more hour of labor, it is basically zero point three three point three three dollars and you can go back and increase this. You can go back and increase this to forty one solve again, find the sensitivity report and see if you get something close to this value for the total profit, an additional value of zero point three three. I'll leave this for you as an exercise to do it yourself, so increase that value to forty one and see if you get something close to the objective function plus zero point three three, which is the Lagrange multiplier. Let's take another application here of product mix problems, let's consider a company that produces two types of genes designer jeans and straight leg jeans, and the production is subject to more than one constraint. So let's deal with a problem here where you have more than one constraint, and these constraints are basically the time available on the time available for the fourth cutting and sewing. And also the amount of cloth available to us. So we have three types of constraint resource constraints, and the company sells its jeans to several stores. [00:10:54:00] But the demand is dependent on the price we've been all along, assuming that the demand is not affected by the price. So no matter how you price the product, you will eventually sell them. And this is not very realistic. And a more realistic assumption is to say, well, the demand depends on the price, and it is given according to some relationship. So let's suppose that the relationship for between the demand and the price is given as follows where one represents the designer, the number of designer jeans that you sell and X to number of straight leg jeans that you sell. And they are defined according to this relationship. So if I increase the price of the designer jeans, it will reduce the total amount I sell because it will affect the demand. The higher the price, the less the less you will sell. Typically, the less you will sell. You get to a point where if you increase the demand, the price so much you will have a zero point zero zero products that you're selling from either one of them. So these are the equations. Suppose that we know this from historical data. We know this from some regression model, that this is the relationship between the amount that you sell and the price. And the more you increase the price, the less products you will sell. And suppose that the cost of the designer is 12 dollars and the cost of the straight jeans, straight leg jeans is $9, so we are given the cost as well. [00:12:28:18] The production of the both types of jeans is subject to the following constraints The material constraint, which is two x one plus two point seven x two, is less than or equal to six thousand. So basically what we're saying is you need two yards of cloth to produce a one designer jeans and you need point seven yards to produce one unit of straight leg jeans. You also have a constraint on the cutting and soon time. So the three point three point six minutes per jeans of designer jeans and two point nine minutes of the straight leg jeans. As far as the seven times two point seven minutes per designer jeans and 8.5 minutes of straight leg jeans, the cutting time and the suit times. This is the amount available for us and we cannot exceed this amount and this is the amount available or the number of yards available to us to produce the jeans. So we have to respect these constraints when we solve the problem. And excel, this would be the model where I have my demand for the designer jeans, which is 1500. In this case, the equation that I use is the 1500 500 minus twenty four point six by the price for the designer jeans and the demand for. The straight leg jeans is twenty seven hundred minus sixty three point eight by the price for the straight leg jeans. [00:14:14:00] So the demand, as you can see, is dependent on the price and the more the higher the price, the less the demand. So if I priced these at zero, I will have 1520 700. But if I price them at 10, this would be less if I price them at 100. This will be less and you're getting even into the negative demand. So at a certain point, I'm going to hit the zero, the zero demand. Nobody's going to buy it if you price it too high. The profit is also dependent on the price where the profit is. Defy. Minus 12, so the price minus the cost of $12 and the profit for the profit for the straight leg jeans is the price the p P2 minus nine, which is the cost, and here is the sum product of the profit by the demand to give me the net profit. Not that the nonlinearity is coming from the fact that the demand is dependent on PE. So it's a function of PE and also the profit is dependent on PE. So and when I multiply in the objective function, the profit by the demand, I will have a quadratic term of PE one and the quadratic term of PE two. These are my constraints where, for instance, the time the amount of cloth available is the amount of cloth that to be used is two yards by the amount of demand from designer jeans, plus two point seven by the amount of demand from for the straight leg jeans. [00:15:55:25] The same concept applies for the the times, the cutting time and some time all over. I want to maximize my profit. The the green sell by changing the prices P1 and P2 right here and the constraints are that I cannot exceed my resources. So the left hand side here, the active sales must be less than or equal to the right hand side of six thousand eighty five hundred and fifteen thousand. And make sure that this is checked to mean that P1 and P2 are non-negative and the silver that I will use is the nonlinear solver. When I had sold, I get the message from silver saying that all constraints and optimality conditions are satisfied. This means it found the optimal solution and it's confident about it. And if I say OK, I will have. These are the prices that I should set the jeans at. So the designer jeans, I should sell it at thirty six and forty nine cents and the straight leg jeans should set it at twenty five sixty six cents. And that would would maximize my profit without exceeding my constraints. I still have some. I still have some resources available to me. However, the problem here is not only about using the resources, the since I have dependency between the demand, I have dependency between the price and the demand. It is not necessarily that I will use all of the material and time available to me to produce the the products because at a certain point, if I produce more or I price if I, I price differently to use more of these resources, I will end up losing on the profit so we don't want to. [00:17:50:09] We don't want to get into a suboptimal solution. So that would be the ultimate solution for this problem with multiple constraints. Another application of nonlinear programming is the facility location problem, where suppose that we have a facility that we are going to build or lease, and that facility serves several customers around it or several other facilities. And what we are interested in is minimizing the distance between this facility that we are trying to locate and the rest of the facilities around it. Based on the amount of distance, based on the amount of travel that we will have to do between this facility and the existing facilities, and the distance can be calculated by this equation. Euclidean distance will if you are given the coordinates of X one and of X and X X and Y I's this, this equation will get you the the straight distance. So assuming that I know the coordinates for the customers or the existing facilities X and Y, these are the coordinates X and Y are the coordinates for the facility that I'm trying to locate. In other words, these are my decision variables, so I clearly this distance is a nonlinear function and my objective would be to locate the facility in a way that will minimize the total distance traveled. [00:19:24:17] Given that I know the number of trips that I will have to make between the different facilities and this new facility, so the objective function would be the distance between the facility and the new facility and the existing facilities and facilities that already exist multiplied by the how many trips I'm going to have to make between the facility, the new facility and the existing facilities. And I add them up for all facilities that will give me my total distance or my total travel distance. This is again, the equation for the distance, and this is what each term means is the distance and T is the amount of trips. An example will make it easier for us to understand. So suppose I have facilities in these towns and I'm giving the coordinates of each facility, and I'm also giving the annual the expected annual trips, how many trips are expected to travel between the new facilities and the existing facilities. So I'm expected to do 75 trips between the new facility and this one, one or five trips between the new facility and this one and so on. So what I want to accomplish is to determine the coordinates of X and Y for the new facility so so that I minimize the total distance travelled and that total distance is reflected by this function. The distance multiplied by the number of trips. And I add them up for all facilities and that will give me the minimum total distance travelled for that new facility. [00:21:06:18] So let's take a look at Excel and see how we can do this. So in this case, it's a it's a it's a rescue squad facility that I'm trying to locate, which is X and Y. Initially, I don't know the coordinates of, uh, X and Y. These are the coordinates of the new facility. These are giving coordinates to me for all of the existing facilities, and these are the number of trips also given to me. The distance is reflected by this function, the square root function that I just discussed, and that would give me the distance between this facility and they they x-y facility over here. So if I located at zero and zero, this will be the distance. This is the second distance for the second between the facility and the existing facility, the second existing facility. And then you want that, I'm trying to look it and so on. For all facilities, the objective function is simply the sum product of the distance by the number of trips. So if the distance happened to be twenty eight twenty eight between the new facility, that happened to be at zero and zero, I just arbitrarily put zero zero, then multiplied by how many times I'm going to take this trip. Seventy five times that gives me the total distance for between the new facility and the first existing facility, and this is the total distance between the second facility and the new the new facility I'm trying to locate and so on. [00:22:46:08] And this would be my objective function and solver. I will I don't have any constraints. I want just to minimize the total distance which is right here by changing these, by changing these coordinates. And I don't have any constraints other than these are non-negative constraints zero or above. And when I had solve it found an optimal solution or constraints and optimality conditions are satisfied. And what this is telling me is that I should, I should, I should look at this facility at these coordinates. I should locate this facility, this facility at this coordinates in order to minimize the distance, the total distance traveled. Given that I know the number of trips, it's important when you solve problems, non-linear problems to look at the message that you get from solver sometimes in this case, it said. In this case, it said all constraints and optimality conditions are satisfied and some other cases, it may say all constraints are solved converge to a solution, and all constraints have been satisfied. This means that it is not confident about a global optimal solution. It knows that this is a local solution, but it is not confident about a global optimal solution because this type of problems that is much harder to find to guarantee the optimal solutions for. And so from a modeling perspective, there is really little difference between. There is really little difference between how you would solve a linear problem versus a nonlinear problem, but from a solution methodology perspective like how the problem is solved, they're actually very, very different.",4462,"[ 0.00719369  0.0076038  -0.00675333 ... -0.00801391  0.00966106

We refer to the colonial paneling as X1 and the western paneling as X2. These are our decision variables, and we would like to maximize profit. The company has already figured that this is how the profit equation looks like, so some suppose that in this case, this is given to us already. Twenty-five X1 minus 0.8 X2 X1 squared plus 30 X2 minus 1.2 X2 squared and the constraint that I have is just labor. Where I have the amount of hours for each type of what the number of sheets, for each type of wood is given to me in this equation, where it must be. For each sheet of x one and two sheets of X two, I need forty hours. [00:01:20:17] So, the total amount of hours is equal to 40 hours. So if I multiply the number of sheets by two from type two plus the number of sheets of type one by one. So it takes one hour compared to two hours of x one for x one, compared to two hours for X two. So this is the non-linear program that's given to us, and we want to implement it and solve it within excel. [00:01:47:03] And in Excel, initially, I don't know what the amounts are, so these are my decision variables. These are my decision variables, and the objective function is to maximize profits, so if you look at this equation, basically it is the same equation that you saw on the PowerPoint, the 25x where this is x one minus 0.8 x one squared. So this carrot sign that you see is the square is the way to do an excel squared and plus 30x two, which is the cell C six minus one point two by C x two squared. Typically, I don't like to put the equation to type in the coefficients in the cell. So what you could do is to do four cells four x one x one squared x two x two squared, and then you put the coefficients underneath these and use the same product as we've been doing all along. But in this example, since it's small and it is since I have x one x one square x two x two squared, maybe it's not very meaningful to have these listed as separate cells, so I included them in one cell. If you have a lot of equations, our length equations, you don't want to do what I did here. But this is a relatively straightforward, simple equation that I typed directly into the cell. So that's my objective function and these are my decision variables. [00:03:26:03] My constraint is simple it's x one plus two x two. So this is my x one plus two x two, which must be equal to 40. In solver, I'm maximizing my profit where the objective function is this cell, the green cell highlighted and my decision variables are the yellow cells, and my constraint is that this cell must be equal. Cell C nine must be equal to 40 hours, which is plugged into this e nine-cell. My constraints are nonnegative, and the solver that I will use is the nonlinear solver. If you use the linear solver, it will give you an error because clearly, my objective function is nonlinear. [00:04:15:23] Options, there is nothing much in the options. This is not going to matter whether you check it or not, because you don't have any integer constraints. And when I hit solve, I need to be careful to look at the solvers' message. It found a solution of constraints and optimality conditions that are satisfied. That means it found the optimal solution. In this case, x one is fifteen point five and X two is twelve point three. These are the optimal number of sheets that must be used to maximize the profit giving us three hundred eighty-two point seventy-three, and that would be the optimal solution. So in this case, this is just purely an example for implementing in Excel, a model that's already given to us, and that would be the ultimate solution.",1160,"[-0.00107913 -0.00227465 -0.00420356 ... -0.01102922 -0.01098129

Lastly, we will analyze the performance of a queue system with multiple servers and finite queues and describe the challenges of balancing customer service times with operational costs.; Transcript: [00:00:01:20] Let's take a problem on London non-linear programming in this problem, we have a police department that wants to allocate a certain number of police patrol cars to different places within a city so they partition the city into four quadrants. And the department has two cars that they want to assign to the different to the four quadrants the department assigned assigns the quadrants to the per shift to the different quadrants, such that they want the response time to be less than 10 minutes. As they as they make this assignment, the relationship between the crime rate and the number of cars assigned and also the response time and the number of cars assigned is governed by this equation. So this equation can be coming from a different model like a regression model or something else where we have two parameters. Why is the response? It can be the crime, and X is the number of police cars. And also it can be the response time because there is a strong correlation between how many cars you have and how much time they take. Also, they are governed by similar equation, and they have two different parameters A and B that they are given to us and X is the number of cars. So if you look at the data, A and B are parameters. When applied to crime, you can plug in the crime rates, parameters and B into that equation over here, and that gives you the amount of crimes or the number of crimes and that's expressed as crimes per 1000 people. [00:01:55:03] And the response time is in minutes, and if you plug it into a few plug in the parameters for the time, it gives you the response time. So as I said, the rationale of this equation is not necessarily known to us, but it is the result of some model or some analysis. Ok, so what we want to know is what is the assignment to the four quadrants such that the response time cannot exceed 10 minutes and we want to minimize the overall crime? To start with a mathematical model. If I define the if I define EXI as being the number of police cars, a number of cars. Assigned. To Quadrant. I. Where I can go from one to two, three four, we have four quadrants. So the objective function would be to minimize Z, which is the total crime rate. As governed by the relationship that's given to us. So if I keep if I plug in the the rates, so if I the prime rate, the crime rate is equal to a plus B over X. All right. So this would be. Maybe we should move this. To hear as a side note, so that we keep our eye on it. [00:03:49:20] And so there would be equal to the data is given to me. Right here. So I can just make use of this data into the objective function. So the crime, the total crime would be. Point to four, which is a here for the first Quadrant Plus. Point one five divided by x one. So that's for the first quadrant, the crime for the first quadrant, for the second one is 0.37 plus point twenty one, divided by X two. And for the third one, it is a point. Twenty one plus point one two divided by x three. And finally, point forty eight. Plus point three divided by X four. So that's my objective function. And my constraints are subject to. X1. The number of the total number of cars 20, so X1 plus X2 plus X3 plus X4 is less than or equal to 20. And I also want to make sure that this response times less than 10 minutes. So if I plug in the parameters A and B into the equation, into this equation and make it less than 10, that becomes my time constraint. So it will be in this case for +11. Divided by X1 is less than or equal to 10 eight plus eight divided by X to Stanton, six plus 10 divided by X three. And finally, three plus nine divided by X4 is less than or equal to 10. [00:06:10:29] And finally, all XS. So x1, x2, x3 x4 is less than or equal to zero. Notice that I didn't include here a constraint on integers, so we can just solve this problem without the integer restriction. And if the results are hard to. Approximate. We can add a constraint, an integer constraint. So potentially you can also. So if I as a as a as a side note, you can. Also make this. A. Integer and integer. Program. By adding. A constraint. The constraint can be X one x, two x three and X four are all integers. We solve the problem in both ways, and we solve the problem both ways and then discuss it and teachers. So to implement this and excel. To implement this in Excel. I have set up the spreadsheet right here, so the quadrants are one two, three four. These are my decision variables. Initially, let's say I assign anything, let's say if I assign one to one car to each quadrant. These these are my decision variables. This is given data to me the A and B parameters. The crime is I take a plus b divided by X one and the same thing for two. It will be a plus b divided by X two and so on. And for their time, I also take a and B from the response time and a plus b divided by X one A-plus, B divided by X two and so on. [00:08:36:19] This response time is simply a constant that I'm going to use in solver. My objective function is to minimize the sum of the crime. Ok, fair quadrant, so I add them up all of them, and these are the number of cars. Ok, now in solver. My objective is to minimize this green cell, minimize by changing the decision variables right here, the yellow cells. And if you look at the total number of cars, which is the sum of the yellow cells must be less than or equal to 20. And this range of cells for the response time must be less than or equal to 10. Each one of them must be less than or equal to 10. And this is a non-linear program because I divide by X, so if you have one over X, that's a nonlinear function and they're all non-negative and not safe that I didn't include any integer variables and my solver is the nonlinear solver. And when I had solved, solver says that it funds all all constraints that optimal conditions are satisfied. So if I keep this answer, I look at the number of cars four four five five twenty seven, three, nine, eight and six point three. That gives me a total of 20, and my objective function is one point forty five. [00:10:01:17] Now, so one way to deal with this is to say, OK, let me just round these numbers, but that doesn't guarantee optimal solutions. It doesn't guarantee optimal solution. And. If I one way to deal with this is that say, I can round these so you can round this to four. Vista five. Vista four and Vista six. That gives me 19 cards, so I have one car left, although the response time is also guaranteed to be less than 10. I'm not utilizing one of the cars, so approximating may not be exactly so if I look back, if I put this back the same way they were. It seems that this would make sense to be before. Maybe this would make sense to be six these two. Maybe I can play a little bit with them if I assign four and six. One way is to do four and six. That gives me 20 or six and four, so that gives me a one point forty five to five versus if I do six and four, it gives you a little bit of a higher number. So maybe the first one is better instead of guessing and approximating, given that cars are integer entities, I can formulate. So if I can solve this back the same way at the this is the exact optimal solution with the fractional values. [00:11:31:05] So you know that this is the absolute best value that you can get. I can enforce the integer constraint, which is what I did in this spreadsheet. So the difference is in solver, where I have these defined these cards defined as integers. And when I had solved, I got this solution at one point forty five to. If you notice, compared to this, one point four, five one three, slightly less. And but this one is an integer solution, so I would recommend to to take this approach because that gives you the optimal integer solution without having to round any numbers. So that would be my optimal solution. The reason, in some cases, you may want to start with an integer solution and see what you get. Sometimes a program like this or a problem like this can be very time consuming to solve. And in this case, you may try to solve it as a non integer program. But if it is easy and quick to solve, I would use an integer program over a non integer program. But sometimes, if it is very time consuming to solve, you can remove that integer constraint and go to a solution like this and play a little bit with the numbers so that you are within the neighborhood of the the optimal solution to give you a decent, a decent solution.",2144,"[ 0.01219422  0.01149545 -0.00661091 ... -0.00655611 -0.0159347

[00:00:35:07] A graphical. [00:00:37:14] Representation of the function. [00:00:39:13] We still. [00:00:40:11] Having probably a hard time even identifying which one of. [00:00:43:14] These hills is the optimal. [00:00:47:10] Solution. So if you can imagine yourself in the middle. [00:00:52:06] Of this surface. [00:00:54:00] And you are looking around you to find the optimal, the highest point, which is the optimal solution. If you are in this. [00:01:02:08] Area over here, at this area over. [00:01:04:14] Here, you may think. [00:01:06:11] That if this area is too far. [00:01:09:06] From you, you may think that the optimal. [00:01:11:06] Or the highest point is over here. Just like if. [00:01:13:07] You are on a mountain and you don't see beyond a certain point. [00:01:18:13] It is difficult for. [00:01:19:13] You to know within a certain region like this region, the highest what the highest point is. [00:01:26:10] So a place like this, we call it. [00:01:29:02] Local, optimal, which means that within this. [00:01:31:07] Neighborhood I have, I. [00:01:34:07] Can identify. [00:01:35:10] This as a local. [00:01:36:10] Optimal within maybe this neighborhood. [00:01:39:00] This is a local optimal. This is a local optimal. So I have. [00:01:42:06] A bunch. [00:01:43:00] Of local. [00:01:44:07] Optima. [00:01:45:10] However. [00:01:47:03] Usually what would be of interest to me is within a certain range. I'm looking. [00:01:51:11] For the. [00:01:52:13] Global one, the highest point of. [00:01:54:14] All local. [00:01:57:10] Maxima in this case if we are maximizing. So but that's not an easy thing to do. [00:02:04:11] It is most. [00:02:06:08] Of the techniques, the mathematical techniques, they have the tendency to search around them within a certain range and pick the one that that's highest. But sometimes with surfaces that are that complex and in many cases discontinuous or. [00:02:19:05] They have very. [00:02:20:07] Strange nature, it may be difficult to know where. [00:02:25:02] The. [00:02:25:08] The maximum point is. Imagine this point over here. [00:02:29:06] If that was like a needle, if that was a little bit higher to the to. [00:02:34:14] To this point, that would be the highest point. [00:02:38:06] And literally, you are. [00:02:40:00] Looking for a needle in a. [00:02:42:06] Stack of hay. [00:02:43:03] So this problem and this is why optimization problems, especially nonlinear optimization. [00:02:49:06] Are difficult. So although this is a little. [00:02:53:03] Beyond. [00:02:53:10] The the scope. [00:02:55:04] I wanted everyone to get the. [00:02:57:04] Idea. [00:02:58:02] That in nonlinear programming in. [00:03:00:04] Particular, although. [00:03:01:06] We may find the solution, that solution may not. [00:03:03:12] Necessarily be the global. [00:03:06:00] Solution. It may not be. [00:03:07:03] The absolute global solution. [00:03:09:14] So this kind of in this two dimensional graph, we reflect what we mean by local and global solution. [00:03:20:01] So if I have. [00:03:21:01] This function and I'm looking for the maximum value. Okay. If you look around this area, that would be the maximum point. However, this one is the global one. [00:03:32:03] This is. This value for. [00:03:34:00] X corresponds to. [00:03:35:01] A higher level of F of x or z. [00:03:38:01] If this was my objective function. So we call these as maximum look, local maximum values. But this one is the global one. It's easy when you have a graph like this, so it will be easy to identify where that point is. But when you don't, when you have complex function and you don't have. [00:03:58:14] A way to. [00:03:59:08] Represent it graphically, it becomes as if you're searching in the blind, in the dark. [00:04:06:00] So. So there is a lot of. [00:04:07:14] Techniques for finding such solutions. [00:04:10:14] Within the scope of this class. [00:04:12:08] Though, I want you to be careful when you. [00:04:14:07] Use Excel solver. [00:04:16:10] That sometimes the solution that. [00:04:19:08] Excel. [00:04:20:00] Gives you may not necessarily be the global solution if you have a nonlinear problem. And this is. [00:04:24:13] Why if we have the choice. [00:04:27:07] Of modeling a problem as a linear problem, we want to do that because it guarantees optimality while in nonlinear problems. Optimality is not guaranteed and we need to experiment a little bit with different ranges. So for instance, if I have this function that I'm trying to optimize, I'm looking for the optimal solution. [00:04:46:04] One way to check for global optimality is to try a few. [00:04:50:10] Values around this area. Try a few values around this area, try a few values around this area and pick the one that gives you the maximum. So let me take an example to demonstrate this point. If I have this function and in this function it is getting a Z is equal to x minus one multiplied by x, minus two multiplied by x, minus three by x minus four, and x is within the range of 1 to 5. Anywhere between 1 to 5 can be a fraction can be an integer and I'm maximizing. [00:05:21:05] So clearly the global optimal is is right here. [00:05:24:06] It's around the 1.5 level. However, I have a bunch. [00:05:30:01] Of or I have a couple. [00:05:31:09] Of I have. [00:05:32:08] To specifically local to two possibilities here this. [00:05:37:01] Area and this area if I was maximizing if I was minimizing I have here and here and that would be the minimum the minimum value. [00:05:44:14] So very simple to model. I just plug. [00:05:48:11] This into Excel, put a constraint around it between one and five and it should give me the. [00:05:53:05] Solution. Let's go to Excel. [00:05:55:03] And try this. Try this example. So in Excel. I plugged in a some values, a bunch of values. So this is my these are my decision. This is my decision variable. So if I'm to highlight it. And this is my objective function and I have different, different values. These values are simply just to. [00:06:21:03] Plot the. [00:06:21:09] Graph. Technically, you wouldn't even need these values if you didn't want to look at the graph. So I just added some values included some values. [00:06:29:04] Just to plot this graph. So this. [00:06:31:06] Part down here, I don't really need to. [00:06:33:13] Solve this problem. [00:06:34:14] All what I need is the, the objective function representation, which is right here, x1x minus one by x minus two by x minus three by x minus four by x minus five. And. And this is my decision variable x. So when I plugged in. [00:06:59:11] And this is the global. [00:07:01:02] Optimal, which is around 1.41, that gives me three and a half. [00:07:05:11] Now if I started with if I if I had started with, let's say a value like over here, let's say. [00:07:14:02] 3.5. [00:07:17:01] If I start with a value. [00:07:18:09] Like 3.5 and I when I. [00:07:20:11] Go to solver. [00:07:21:13] The only thing that I have is my objective function. Maximize my objective function. This is my decision variable. Only one cell and I have constraints that this cell is less than five. [00:07:34:03] Or greater. [00:07:34:14] Than or greater than one between one and five, basically. And I'm going to use a nonlinear solver. [00:07:39:05] If I hit solve, I start with 3.5. And if I hit solve, it says solver. [00:07:48:00] Has converged to the current solution. And that's an indication for you to know that this doesn't guarantee an optimal solution. It says converge to a solution. It doesn't know whether for sure it's optimal or not, but it converge to. [00:08:01:09] A reasonable solution if I hit. Okay. It's still identified here. [00:08:09:07] It identified this solution 1.4. [00:08:13:12] As. [00:08:14:03] The optimal solution or the solution it converge to, which corresponds to 3.54. [00:08:19:03] So clearly, if. [00:08:20:10] You didn't start with the right point, so if I instead of starting from 3.5, I start from 1.5. Go to solver and hit solve. [00:08:31:06] Now it's also says converge to a solution. [00:08:35:08] And in. [00:08:36:02] This case, the. [00:08:37:08] Solution is 3.6, which is right here the maximum and corresponds to X value of 1.3. So as you can see, because I started within the neighborhood of that point, I was able to identify the global optimal solution. However, when I started it within the neighborhood. [00:08:56:05] Of a local solution, it I, it. [00:09:00:07] Found. [00:09:01:01] That this is the solution. So although this. [00:09:03:09] Is not. [00:09:04:03] Really the global. [00:09:05:01] Solution. [00:09:05:07] This is the global solution. [00:09:07:00] You can try as an exercise to turn this over into. [00:09:10:01] A. [00:09:11:00] Minimization problem and start. [00:09:12:10] With this. [00:09:14:07] Point, which is around 2.4 and see if it identifies this as a minimum. [00:09:19:03] And start also. [00:09:20:11] Here around 4.5 or so, 4.6, and see if it identifies this as a minimum value. [00:09:27:04] And so. [00:09:28:03] As you can see here, I identified for you. [00:09:30:06] The the. [00:09:31:04] Global and. [00:09:32:02] Local. [00:09:32:13] Solution. Depending on the starting point. So if I start with point around one, you will get 1.3. [00:09:42:04] While if you start with. [00:09:45:11] A solution around. [00:09:46:11] Three, you will. [00:09:47:11] Get 3.5. [00:09:49:06] Which is actually this is the global. [00:09:51:12] Solution and. [00:09:53:12] So if you. [00:09:54:06] Are encountered with a problem, although you may not have the. [00:09:57:04] Graph like this. [00:09:59:05] A nonlinear a nonlinear problem. [00:10:01:09] It is worth actually. [00:10:04:01] Especially when you get a message from solver saying it has converged to a solution, it is worth trying different values within over the range of the solution. And also check the feasibility and the the. [00:10:16:11] The, the. [00:10:19:12] The nature of the solution, whether it makes sense to you or not. Maybe you can try by hand some solutions. Maybe you can try randomly some solutions in nonlinear programming. It's a difficult problem and there is no in some cases, there isn't an easy way to identify. [00:10:34:01] The global the global optimal. So it is. [00:10:36:07] Worth trying different starting points, just like what we tried in this example in.

Scheduling is the allocation of jobs to machines, the allocation of jobs or tasks to scarce resources that we refer to as machines. If we had a large number of resources where they're not scarce, then the problem is not challenging or trivial. But, most realistic applications include scarce resources where we try to optimize these resources and we need to figure out how to allocate certain tasks to certain resources, or machines. So a job or a task can be a manufacturing of parts. It can be a patient that needs a certain procedure. It can be a plane that is looking for a gate to park at and so on. So when we refer to a job, we don't necessarily mean always manufacturing jobs, but we can. It can mean any task that needs to be performed using some resource, and the resources can be the machines in a manufacturing environment. They can be the doctors who are going to perform the procedure on the patients, and the patients are the jobs. Basically, they can be the airport gates that will accept the planes and to deplane people or to board people. So the resources can be thought of as a machine or a human or any or a computer, anything that can perform the task at hand. Scheduling problems are usually combinatorial optimization problems in which we typically want to minimize or maximize a certain objective function, or functions, while meeting certain constraints or restrictions on the jobs or the machines. So it is actually an optimization problem in that sense, where we have a certain objective that we're trying to optimize and we have certain constraints that we need to satisfy. When we refer to combinatorial optimization problems, it means that you have a lot of combinations from which you can choose and you are looking for that single combination that will give you the optimal solution. So when you have a lot of choices, the problem becomes difficult because you have to search for that best choice as if you're searching for a needle in a haystack.

So the scheduling problems are usually difficult to solve, at least most of them, and they have many, many applications realistic applications. Here are some examples of application areas. Of course, manufacturing is the most typical where you may have a single machine, a single resource that needs that can process jobs and needs. You need to schedule these jobs on the single resource. You can have parallel machines, meaning machines that they can run in parallel and perform the same job. You may have job shops where the jobs can visit more than one machine and also flow shops that are similar to assembly lines. You may have also in manufacturing the problem of workforce scheduling: how to schedule people around work where people may serve different work and different shifts, and you need to schedule them according to some requirements. This is in manufacturing, in examples in manufacturing. There are many other examples in services. You can think of hotel and airline reservation systems as a big scheduling problem; in health care where you can look at the scheduling of the operating rooms; you can look at the scheduling within labs or emergency rooms or recovery areas. There are a lot of planning and scheduling problems within the health care environment. Also, the scheduling of patients, assigning patients to doctors. Also we mentioned the operating rooms, outpatient or inpatient rooms and so on, transportation and distribution problems. This is a very common type of applications if you heard of the traveling salesman problem, or the vehicles routing problem. These are problems that are common in package delivery, package delivery services, also in travel planning and so on.

Railway scheduling is another area within the arena of transportation, and there are more applications in the computer and communication area. You have when you have servers or machine CPUs that can process multiple jobs, either in series or in parallel, you need an algorithm to decide which job to process next in call centers. When you call for something and you have a call center in which the calls are routed to different people to answer it. Or different automated services? You have a scheduling problem there. Timetabling applications in which they are more known to be satisfaction problems, meaning you're in time-tabling problem. You are typically trying to find a feasible schedule than an optimal schedule. In any case, it is considered a scheduling problem where, as an example, you may want to assign lectures to rooms at a university- you may want to schedule exams. You may want to assign instructors to courses or to rooms and so on. So that's the timetabling within an academic university sports scheduling when you have games that they need to take place in different locations. Flight scheduling as well. This is a very big area and for scheduling, which is the airline in general, has many difficult scheduling problems, including flight scheduling. In another area of applications were housing, so HGV is the automated guided vehicles, which are basically robotic robotic vehicles that they go and pick orders and from warehouse to put it together and ship it to a customer. How to schedule these ATVs and how to route them around the facility. Maintenance is also a common area for scheduling, where you need to decide on the preventive maintenance for manufacturing or in some cases, maybe for a fleet of ships or planes. You also consider scheduling problems when things break down and you need to maintain them. And how do you reschedule your tasks and jobs?

These are some examples of of applications in this module, we will refer to jobs, jobs and machines to refer to the tasks that need to be scheduled, and the machines are the resources that they need to perform them. And the general principle is applicable to any of the previous areas that we mentioned in this particular case. This is a general exam example where you have a bunch of jobs and jobs that you need to schedule on machines. So in this case, you have three machines and you have end jobs, and the size of the job can reflect the processing time duration for each job. So if you have a set a set of jobs, they may be all available at one point in time. Or maybe some new ones will arrive. In this case, you are trying to decide which job to send to which machine and to optimize a certain objective function. So jobs can be processed by any of these machines and they have different processing times as reflected by the size of these circles. So it may take 10 minutes, 20 minutes and so on, on different machines or one of the machines who are which are capable of processing any of the jobs. And we want to assign them to machines so that we optimize a certain objective. That objective can be maximizing the throughput on the machines it can be. It can be minimizing the time in the system. It can be minimizing the the tardiness of the jobs to their customers and so on. So we may have different objective functions as we discuss. But, that's generally speaking what the problem is about, I have a set of tasks that I need to schedule on a set of machines, and I need to figure out the best order of tasks and best assignment of tasks. The machines in which order they will go on each machine to optimize certain criterion.

As we will see, the completion time is the main decision variable that will result in in due to changing the order of the jobs, and this completion time plays a significant role in calculating most objective functions. So in this slide here, it's just a simple exercise to show you how completion times can be can be calculated. So in this case? Suppose that you have these five jobs and they have certain amount of processing times, PE refers to the processing time. So, P4 is the processing time of job for P5, is the processing time of job 5 and so on. And suppose that you order them in this way. As you see where the length of each box, or rectangle, represents the amount of processing required. So, if I am to calculate the completion time for this order of jobs on a single machine: for the first job, which is job number 4, the completion time (the time at which a task is completed) is equal to the same as the processing time because it's the first job assuming we start at time zero. So the completion time, if that job takes 20 minutes, then the completion time will be 20 if we start at time 0. Not that I used C[1], although this is job four and it has a processing time of four, you see 1 in brackets to reflect that. This is the completion time of the job in the first position, and this is the completion time for the job in the second position, and the third position and so on and so forth. So, in this case, the completion time of job one is, or the job in the first position is, for the same amount as the processing time of job four. Then, it's followed by job five. So, in this case, job five will wait for job one to complete and then I need P5 amount of processing. So, the completion time is 42 equal to C1 plus P5. So, the previous completion time of the job in the first position, plus the the duration of processing time for five, for job four, and for job one which is in the third position. It's equal to the previous completion time, plus the processing time of the current job, which is P1. So in other words, I will take the completion time of a certain job is equal to the completion time of the previous job, plus the processing time of the current job, except for the first job, because nothing precedes it and that that number will be zero. That's the completion time that previous the preceding completion time is zero.

So, if I am to write a generic equation for the completion, how we calculate the completion time, the completion time for the for the job in J position is equal to the completion time of the job in the previous position A plus the processing time of the current job, and that equation is applicable to all of these, all of these jobs. In some cases, you will notice that we tend to just remove these brackets and from the context of the of the example or the problem, we know we can figure out whether we are referring to job C[j]. Means the completion time of job or the job in position. It's just formally. This is the formally this is the way we should drive the completion time of a job in a certain position and if I do C[J] Instead, if I do CGI, it means that this is the completion time of job j directly. So if it will be in other words, and this in this example, in this example, see. Uh, one is actually the same as saying C[4] without the brackets, because four is in the first position. And from there, sometimes even if we drop these brackets and we still mean it is the position of that job, we should know it from the context of the problem.

Now, to go back to our main objective of addressing scheduling problems if and to show you the point of how the scheduling algorithms and models can be useful in this case. For instance, if I look at the top part of the chart and which I have three machines, and I happen to assign the jobs in this order or and in this allocation, so each one of these rectangles represents a job and that the length of the rectangle represents the processing time. So if suppose in some ways, I, according to some logic, I assigned the jobs and sequence them on each machine. In this way, the C-MAX, as you will see in in this module, the C-MAX is the time we need to complete all jobs or known as the max span. Very common objective function in the area of scheduling and this C-MAX, because it's the maximum of all completion times, it's the time that we will finish all jobs. And in this case, it will be that the this this amount here. So if you can imagine that you have the time on the x axis here, this can be something like two hours or three hours or twenty minutes, whatever the units we have here for the projector. So the C-MAX is the time that we need to finish all jobs or the maximum completion time or the max span and if I happen to schedule them this way, this C-MAX may be, let's say, three hours or any number that may add up. And if I suppose suppose that I move this job from this location instead of assigning to machine one, suppose that I assigned it actually to Machine two. And this is what this second scenario reflects over here, where I assigned the The Job two machine two. And in this way, I managed to finish all jobs earlier here. It took me up to this point to finish all jobs, which is basically until I completed the last job. If I move this job, if I move this one to this location. In other words, I assign it to Machine two, I will end up with the scenario that you see here on the bottom. And as you can see, the C-Max is less than the C-Max in the first scenario. So technically, I saved the difference between C-MAX one and C-Max to these two. That difference in time, I managed to save the the the let's say, if that's a manufacturing plant, I managed to save the the schedule certain amount of time. That amount of time can be utilized in use in processing something else, or it can be done used for maintenance or anything else. So the way I assign jobs to machines and the way I sequence these jobs on certain machine will impact significantly the throughput. It will impact the time to complete all jobs that will impact the due date. It will impact a lot of objectives. So that's a general example, and these are some of the possible scenarios that I can, I can use this. We refer to this as a Gantt chart. So this is known as a Gantt chart. And and it's very common to use it to represent scheduling problems, especially when you have multiple machines and you have if you have single machine, it's common to use just as the the numbers or the permutation to represent it and sometimes Gantt chart as well.

So in general, we need to in any scheduling problems, in any scheduling problem, we need to first define what scheduling environment I'm dealing with. Do I have a single machine? Do I have multiple machines? Do I have them in parallel? Do I haven't been serious? What do I have exactly? Then I have to decide, depending on the context of the problem, I have to decide what objective function to use. What is important? Is it important to me, the due date? Is it important to maximize the throughput? Is it both of them? So I need to define exactly what's of interest to my particular situation. And once I know that I can use certain models or algorithms to assign jobs to machines in order to optimize certain objectives. So if my objective is to me the due date, I can assign the jobs to machines in a different way. Then if I want to maximize the throughput, they both objectives are not the same and the outcome will be different. Now, once I assign the jobs to machines, in some cases you may have to know how to sequence the jobs on each machine. In some cases it doesn't matter. They can go in any sequence, and the result will be the same. However, in some cases, the sequence matters. Once I sequence the jobs on each machine, then I can easily calculate the job, start times and completion times, given that I know they're processing time. So if I know the processing time, I would be able to figure out from the sequence, the start times and the completion times. Not that the start time and the completion times they are, they are. They are basically from one. You can tell what the other one is. So there is a lot of linearity, if you, if you will, where if I know the start time of a certain job, I know it's processing time, then I can find it is completion time. So if I know that this is the start time of a job. Ok, so if if T is the start time of a job and if P.J. is the processing time of this job, then I can easily calculate the completion time of that job. Similarly, if I know the processing time of a job and I know the completion time, I can subtract the the processing time from the completion time of that job and I will get the start time.

So knowing the start time is equivalent to knowing the completion time, although they are different, but the difference is going to be in the processing time for that job. And also, I have to consider what restrictions, what processing restrictions and constraints I have, for instance, not all jobs may be available at the time of scheduling, so some jobs may arrive over time. That has a significant impact on the solution. I may have set up times, I may have breakdowns, I may have different constraints and restrictions, and I need to consider them in my problem. So these are the most general concerns that we are we usually deal with in most scheduling problems. Defining what environment I am dealing with, what is my objective? What is what is what am I trying to do here? How do I assign jobs to machines? How do I sequence them on the machines? And then I can calculate completion time and objective function values? Once I know the completion times, it's easy usually to calculate the objective functions. And finally, I have to respect any processing restrictions or constraints in this module. We will be going over more details, more models, more algorithms that will that that that will be used for with different environments, different objectives and different constraints.",3896,"[-0.0063028  -0.02014229 -0.00991774 ... -0.00572921 -0.01156514

[00:00:07:20] This notation: we have three fields alpha, beta, and gamma. The first field, alpha, is the machine environment (the scheduling machine environment), whether it's a single machine or multiple machines, or [00:00:24:18] flow Sharp's [00:00:25:13] job shops--whatever that environment that we're dealing with is listed here. The second field is the beta field, in the middle, which is the job characteristics and constraints or any processing restrictions. So, if you have some constraints or some conditions that pertain to the problem at hand, they are listed in the second field. And finally, the gamma field, or the last field is the objective function. If we are minimizing, let's say, the [00:00:59:06] McSpadden or [00:01:00:03] the total completion time tardiness--whatever objective we're trying to accomplish, it is listed in the third field: the gamma field. So, by using this notation, one can--just by looking at a short description using this notation-- tell what the problem is and what conditions are there and what the objective function they need to deal with. Before we get into the details of the different of the three fields, let's just talk about the data that gets into this description. We have two classes of data. The static data or basically the parameters which are given to us. They are known beforehand in deterministic scheduling. And these include the number of resources or the number of the machines (m), the number of jobs (n), the processing time (Pij), which is the amount of time necessary to process J on machine I if that processing is not dependent on the machine. In other words, all of the machines they process at the same speed, then this can be reduced to Pj because all of the machines are the same, so we can have just Pj. But in general, Pij is a more general form. Due date [00:02:27:14] (Dj) of a certain j [00:02:30:21]. The release date of certain j (Rj is the release date). And Wj is the priority, the weight, or the penalty for that job. The second type of data is the dynamic data, or basically the decision variables. The decision variables are all dependent on the completion times. So the completion time (Cj) is not something that's usually given to us. It is something that we calculate and is dependent on the sequence or the assignment of jobs to machines. So, what will determine the value of the objective function? It's basically some form or shape of the objective of the completion times. [00:03:18:21] [00:03:18:21]Starting with the machine environment, which is the first field. The [00:03:23:25] first field includes the scheduling environment we are dealing with. The most common environments are single machine, where you have a set of jobs. The red dots are the jobs and the squares are the machines. So, you have a set of jobs that need to be processed on a single resource or a single machine. And that's known as the Single Machine environment. [00:03:44:29] A Parallel Machine environment in which we have machines that can process jobs in parallel so they can do the machining, the production, or whatever it is that we're modeling. They can do it in parallel. We have three types of machines: parallel machine environments, identical parallel machines, uniform parallel machines, or unrelated parallel machines in case of identical parallel machines. [00:04:16:00] The machines are of the same type and the same capability, so a job can take PJ time. If it is assigned to a machine one or Machine two or machine three, equally the same. So the the there is no significant difference between the capability of a machine one from machine to from machine and. And a situation like this can be found, for instance, in a bank. In many cases, we assume that all of the tellers, they have the same ability to process what the customers are trying to do. So when you go to a deposit or cash a check or do something relatively straightforward, you can go to any of the tellers. And in general, they will be capable of processing what you're looking for at the same speed in case of uniform machines. The difference between the speed, the difference is in the speed between machines. So for instance, this machine can be twice as fast as the second machine may be because it's a newer model or it is simply has a faster capability. The they in uniform machines, the speed factor between the machines is known. In other words, I know that the first machine is twice as fast as the second machine, or the third machine is three times as fast as the second machine and so on. So in uniform machines, we know the relationship between the machines. In case of unrelated machines, the processing times are dependent not only on the jobs that need to be processed, but also dependent on the machines themselves. So we have pig where pig is different from one job to another and also from one machine to another. We encounter situations like this whenever skill is involved. So if you can think of these machines as people, the first person may be very skilled at doing some job while not as skilled, doing another job and vice versa for the second person. So it may take 10 minutes for the first person to do a job, to do the first job while it takes 20 minutes for the second person to do the same job. However, when another job comes along, the first job may be the first machine may be able to do it in 20 minutes, and the second machine may do it in 10 minutes. So it's dependent on the job as well as the machine. And this is the most general type of parallel machines. [00:06:58:23] In case of flow shops, the you can think of it as an assembly line where the jobs they arrive and they get processed on one machine after the other. So it's if you think of it as an assembly line, the job can go in here. It can be, let's say, a computer that's being assembled so the motherboard can be the first step you put on it, maybe a video card and then add to it in the third step with the memory or or sound card or something like this. By the end, you have a finished product. You have different types of floor shops. We have mostly two types. The main basic types are permutation floor shop and general floor shop and permutation floor shop. The sequence of the jobs doesn't change from one machine to another. So if I input job one, followed by Job two, it will keep the sequence all the way through until it's out of the shop in the General Flow Shop. This is not necessarily the case, so I may process job one, followed by Job two, but as they get into the environment, they may switch that sequence to to process Job two and Machine two and then job one, depending on the situation you are dealing with. We refer to the floor shop as F.M. [00:08:20:17] So the floor shop, when you see the term F.M., it means floor shop with machines. So in this case it will be EF3 because I have three machines. If I go back to the previous case, I refer to this as one just because it's a single machine and case of the parallel machine if it's identical. I will refer to it as PM. So in this case, it will be P3, and if it's uniform, I refer to it as cu.m, so it will be Q3 in this case, if they were uniform, where the speed the factor between these machines is known and in case of unrelated machine, it's referred to it as R.M. Where is the number of machines? And in this case, it will be our three. Floor shop, as we said, it will be FM and the job shop, which we refer to as Jay. And where is the number of the machines in this case, I have one two three four five six seven eight. So in this case, it will be great and in case of a job shop, they each job has a certain route that it follows and it processes accordingly. So if I have job one, followed by Job two and this is the red followed, it follows the red route. It will go from this machine to this machine. Then following the red route, it will go to this machine, then it will exit the shop. [00:09:46:13] So basically the route for this job is this way. It may. It will go. This way and then to this machine and then it will exit another job, may follow a different route where you start with maybe if we look at the at the blue job, it may start from here. Go to this machine, then go to this machine, then go back here and then it will exit or another. The another job, the the the light blue, where I have a the dotted line over here, the blue dotted line. The job may start from here. Goes to this machine then to here, then to here, and it leaves and and so on. So a job shop, obviously is the more the most complex where the job may get processed on multiple machines. And it happens according to a specific order of machines. So clearly, they floor shop is just one special case of the job shop. The the floor shop is a key. If you can think of the route that's followed that a job follows that can be considered as a floor shop just one floor shop inside the job shop. There are other environments, but these are the most basic ones. There are derivatives of these environments. So for instance, you hear the term flexible floor shop or hybrid floor shop. You may hear also a flexible job shop and so on, where you get combinations of environments nested within one big environment. [00:11:31:06] For our purposes, we're going to focus on these basic or even some of these basic environments. Let's look at the second field, the better field in which you describe the restrictions and the constraints for the problem that you are dealing with. I can have release dates, so if I have RJ in the middle field, it means that not all jobs are available at time zero if you didn't have RJ. It means that all jobs are available at time zero way. Another restriction is the president's constraint, and the president's constraint is something can be represented as follows. So if I have PRC. Prc president's constraint, it basically says that a certain job must be processed before you can start another job. You cannot do Job two before job one, you have to start job one first, then job two and you cannot do job four before Job three and possibly you cannot do any of you cannot start on job five before finishing up all of these jobs one to three and four. That's considered the president's constraint, and that's very common in project scheduling. Another another restriction is the set of times in which we have or set up costs. The set up time is when we have a certain amount of time needed to set up the machine before you can process the job. So just think of it as you finished doing a certain job, and now you have to adjust the machine to be capable of processing the next job. [00:13:27:21] The setup times are classified as either sequence independent SJ or sequence dependent as IG. In case of sequence independent. It means that the setup time for Job J is s certain amount that's given to us, regardless how where that job falls in the sequence. So certain job requires always 10 minutes to set up, for instance, in case of sequence dependence at a time, which makes the problem much more complex. The sequence of the job affects the amount of time that that you need to set up the machine. So for, for example. In case of C.J.. So in case of setup time, sequence independent. Set up. The amount of time required, if you have I and then if you have Jay, you may need a certain amount of SJ and whether Jay was processed before I. Or. After I. The amount of time that you need to set up is the same, it doesn't change by changing the sequence. And in the case of sequence dependent. Setup time. If I schedule a job, I followed by job, Jay, I may need a cigar, a certain amount. However, if I switch the sequence and schedule job Jay. Of. Of the amount of time. That you need to set up a machine is different is. J. I. The amount of time is different and even the set of time before they set up time before J. [00:15:44:27] Which is the amount of time you need to set up for Job J. It's this way if you have if you have maybe something else before here, this amount becomes different than. So the sequence of the jobs changes the amount of time need needed to set up for the machine before a certain job. It depends on the sequence. So for instance, you can think of an example in the automotive industry where let's say you're painting the cars and you have black and white cars. If you if you sequence the cars such that you paint a black car first and then followed by a white car, you need to make sure that the painting booth is very, very clean because any small spot of black color will show up on the white car. However, if it was the other way around where you process or you paint the the white car first, then the black car, they that it may take you, you don't really have to be very thorough cleaning the the booth because the black color will actually cover all of the all of the white colors. So it is not it is not that critical. So this problem becomes the problem becomes much more complicated if you have sequence dependence at times, because now not only you have to be concerned about the objective function, but also the set of time changes, and it will impact their objective function value. [00:17:21:24] Another restriction is preemption, and in preemption you basically are allowed to in case of preemption, you are allowed to break up the job and and finish it later on. So typically in scheduling, we say no preemption is allowed. So if you start processing job I, you finish all of it and then you start processing job Jay. Ok, in case of preemption, you can do a little bit of job I. Then you do maybe job, Jay, and then you finish the rest of the job, I. So that's the case of pre-emption. This is you can think of this just like how people operate, in many cases, they can be working on a task, they can stop it and then go do some other tasks, and that's that's known as preemption. Machine eligibility restrictions or personal capability is when certain jobs must be done on a specific machines or in other words, you can or you cannot do a certain job on some other machines. So there is a you can think of it as a skill for a person. You cannot assign certain job to any of the machines. You have to assign it to specific set of machines, and these are the only eligible machines to process that job. We may have a breakdown when you allow for the machines or you take into consideration the that the machines may break may break down, and there is a certain amount of time that you need to go back to normal and operate. [00:19:07:00] Blocking is when a certain job cannot proceed forward because the next machine is blocking its way. Since then, the job ahead of it is still processing and that's very common in flow shops. So in a floor shop something similar to this figure, you may be you may run a job and it's let's say it's processing in machine number two and then you start doing a job to hear on the first machine. And although Job two may be done, it may not be able to proceed forward because this job is still occupying the machine for. Either because the machine is still processing it, or maybe because that machine, that job is blocked by the following machine, we encounter cases like this when we don't have a lot of buffer. If you don't have space between the jobs to between the machines to place the processed jobs, then the job stays on that machine. It will keep it occupied until there is a spot for it in the downstream direction. So this is when we start blocking the the previous machines. That's the concept of blocking recirculation. It's very common in it's common in job shop in job shops. Not all job shops allow for recirculation, but some of them, such as the semiconductor industry, they allow for recirculation. And what this means is that a job. [00:20:39:22] In this case, for instance, we didn't allow recirculation because it the the jobs go from one machine to the next and they exit in case of recirculation, a certain job may go from one to two then to three. Then it may come back to one and exit, or it may come back to one, then come back to two again and then exit. So you allow for loops to happen within the job shop. These are some of the restrictions that are there could be some other ones that are less common, but these are the most common ones. The third field so we covered the first field, which is the environment with a single machine, parallel machine, shop, floor shop. We covered the second field, which is these these fields or these parameters. And third is the objective function or gamma, and the objective function is basically what you are trying to calculate the metric that reflects the performance measure of interest. So I'm very common metric is the C-Max or the mixed band, which is defined as the time you need to complete all jobs and the time you need to complete all jobs known as the C-Max. The reason it's called the C-Max because it's the maximum of all completion times. So if I am to mathematically represent this, I can just say. This is equal to the maximum of C1 C2 all the way to see N, so the maximum of all completion times is the C max, which is the time we complete all jobs. [00:22:14:22] Basically, the maximum completion time is the time that we complete all jobs and this is why it's known as the MC spent. Minimizing this objective function tends to maximize the throughput because you, you, you try to squeeze these jobs as much as possible in the beginning. So and pushing them back to the zero starting point. And by doing this, you finish the jobs in the shorter time, which will allow to process more jobs. And this is why you have the tendency to maximize throughput by minimizing the C-MAX. If you have parallel machines, it also helps with balancing the load because in case of parallel machines. If you try to squeeze these jobs to be processed as soon as possible and this is what this objective accomplishes, then you try to distribute these jobs on the across the different machines so that you minimize the time that you complete all jobs and therefore you will be balancing the load as a as a as a consequence of that. Not necessarily completely and perfectly balancing it, but it will be it will be you will see it more balance than if you had some other types of objective functions. Another common another common objective function is the maximum lateness El Max. Lateness is defined as the difference between the completion time and the due date, so it can be positive, it can be negative if it is if you complete after the due date. [00:23:50:08] In other words, you are late to your due date, then that lateness is positive. However, if you're early, this value will be negative because the completion time will be earlier or less than the due date. So you have a negative or positive values. In this case, we are not interested in adding these up. We are interested in finding the maximum value and minimizing it. Remember, all of these objective functions are dependent on the completion time, which is dependent on the sequence or the assignment of jobs. So these are not known beforehand. Different sequences or assignments, they have different values. So the maximum value is really dependent on what sequence you choose to have or what assignment you choose to make. And you want to do this assignment in a way or sequence in a way. To minimize the maximum value of these of all of these values, what is the rationale for this kind of objective function? If you think of yourself as a manufacturer and you're trying not to, you have deadlines or due dates for your customers, what this objective accomplishes is not to be too late for one of the customers. It doesn't really. It doesn't really help with minimizing the lateness to all customers. It just tries not to be extremely late for one of the customers. [00:25:23:13] So, for instance, if you have two choices where in one choice you can be late a little bit to one or to more than one customer. And and the second choice is to meet all of your customer due dates, except for one that can be really late. In this case, if you minimize the ill max, it will avoid the second scenario where you are really late for one of the customers. And it may be you may be late for multiple customers. So depending on what you're trying to accomplish with respect to your due date, if that's of an importance to you not to be extremely late for one of your customers, this is the right objective function for you. However, if you are trying to be as an athlete at not you trying to be as close as possible to your date across all customers, regardless of the amount of lateness, then you should be looking at the tardiness, objective function and the tardiness objective function. That tardiness is defined just like the lateness, except that we focus only on the positive difference between the completion time and the due date when we take the maximum of C.J. and Jay. There are two possibilities you can be either you can be either late. There are actually three possibilities. You can be early. Where this is the completion time and this is the due date. Or you can be late or you can be just in time. [00:26:59:04] So this is the completion time and this is the due date. Or you can be late or tardy. Where this is the completion time and this is the due date. In this case, the due date is right here, so in the first scenario, if you're early this measure, the tardiness doesn't really concern itself with the airlines, so it takes a zero. So if you have a certain amount of time that you are early, so you completed before the due date, it will assume you have zero tardiness, which makes perfect sense. So if early jobs, they don't matter, they don't help you and they don't hurt you, then the tardiness is a reasonable objective function because it doesn't really care about anything that's early. You can think of it as submitting exams. In many cases, you just concerned not to me not to miss the deadline of the exam, but submitting the exam early in most typical situations. It doesn't matter. Finishing the job earlier. Doesn't really give you any benefit, and it doesn't hurt the objective function. In the second case, when it's just in time, it will be the difference will be zero and it will be. The tardiness will also be zero. So in both cases that that tardiness doesn't count. We don't really get any tardiness, which is a good thing. In the third case, this is when you have the difference between the due date and the completion time. [00:28:20:16] The positive difference is the tardiness of a certain job. G. So when we try to minimize the tardiness, ignore the wait for now, just the tardiness. So if we had summation of TJ, what we're trying to do is to minimize the amount of time that all jobs from job one to end are late to their due date or tardy to their due date. So that's a positive deviation from the due date. We are trying to minimize the total amount of it. The weighted tardiness and most objectives, you can weigh them and they will change the nature of the objective function will change to reflect the priority for a certain job. So if you think of the work as the penalty that you pay for being late to your customer so it can be $1 if you are late by one unit or it can be $10. So that's the the penalty per job WGA or the importance of the job reflected as a cost to being to being late to your customers. So that's the objective of the total weighted tardiness. Another objective known as the total completion time or weighted completion time, so each objective can we can multiply by the weight or not have the weight or have a value of one for the weight. This is the more general case when you have value for work. In this case, minimizing the total completion time tends to minimize the average waiting time in the system or not necessarily just waiting in the queue. [00:29:53:05] It's the average total time in the system to be more accurate, which will also, as a result will minimize the average work in process. So you try to get rid of these jobs from the system and in a reasonable amount of time with fair distribution across all jobs. So this objective function is really more focused on the customers or it's focused on the jobs themselves. So you're trying to minimize the amount of time that they spend in the system. And if that amount of time that they spend in the system is weighted, meaning it costs you a different jobs, they cost you different amounts per unit time, then the WGA is the weight that's associated with each job. And by minimizing this objective function, you tend to minimize the amount of time that the jobs they spend in the system, so it's more focused on the customers. Think of it as a grocery store in which their customers are coming through to checkout. If you're trying to minimize their checkout time between waiting and processing during their checkout, if your objective is focused on throughput and you want to process as many as possible, then you will be minimizing the mix. But if your focus is on the customers and you're trying to minimize the amount of time they spend waiting and checking out, then this is the objective function to use. [00:31:22:18] And any method that will help minimizing this objective function should try to get rid of the jobs or process the jobs with higher weight. First, as we will see shortly. Another objective is the weighted number of tardy jobs in this case. Here we minimize the total amount of tardiness. So if we add up all of these amounts of difference between completion time and due date, that will add up to some number and that number will be the total total tardiness. Then you if you multiply it by weights, then it will be the total amount of weighted tardiness. In this case, we really care only if a job is late or not. We don't really capture whether that job was late by one day or 10 days or 100 days. It just counts 30 jobs. It just count if you missed the due date. Then there is a one. If you don't miss it, it's a zero. So it's a step function. It's a step function that will penalize the objective function if the job is late to its due date. Otherwise, it is zero. It doesn't penalize it for anything. This can be common in some industries, like the airline industries in which you by the end of the week or by the end of the month, you look at the fraction of flights that the certain airline managed to meet, the fraction of flights that they managed to, that they managed to take off on time or land on time. [00:32:59:18] So if you are late to your flight, if the plane is or the fly, the if the plane is late to take off or to land, it means that this value will be won for that particular plane, other or flight, and otherwise it will be zero. So this is more of accounting a counter that will penalize, depending on the number of times you were late to a certain due date. So far, the objectives that we discussed are considered as regular objective functions because they are not decreasing functions of the completion time. What this means is that as the completion time increases, as time passes by and the complexity completion time increases, the objective function value doesn't really improve. It just keeps getting worse and worse. And remember that we're minimizing so higher values of objective functions are bad. And so as you if you think of the completion time here on the x axis as it increases and time passes by and you think of this as the objective function, they the previous objective functions, they are all dependent on the completion time. And generally speaking, they will have a trend like this in that direction, whether it's linear or whether it's step function. It just keeps increasing. Or at least it doesn't decline. It just keeps going up. [00:34:30:01] Or it may stay the same in some cases. So these are known as. Regular objective functions and and the the the amount of or the value for the objective function, it just keeps climbing up as time passes by in case of non regular objective functions where the as as time passes by the potentially the objective function value may improve or it may decline. In other words, you may see something like this as as C.J. becomes an increases the objective function value. It will decline for a while and then it will pick up again because there is the nature of non-regular objectives is is that they it it? It penalizes the early jobs just as bad as the late jobs as an example. So this example of airline maintenance is another objective function known as the total weighted airliners and tardiness. And this, in a sense, captures the the idea of the just in time scheduling, where you penalize jobs that are early by a certain weight and you penalize the jobs that are tardy as well. So this objective function favors favours completing the jobs as close as possible to their duty. So is the airlines, and alpha are alpha. Ge is that they wait for the penalty or the wait for the being early and beta is the penalty or the wait for being tardy or late. So an objective function like this, as time passes by now, you can just imagine that the due date is six months from now and you are already processed. [00:36:34:09] You already processed a certain job all this time. You may have to carry this job in inventory. So this is a penalty that's known as the earliest penalty that is not necessarily a good thing. So as time passes by? The objective function value will increase, enhance or decline, in other words, until it gets very close to the due date and if it passes that you did, then this part, this component of the objective function will kick in and it will start penalizing the objective function according to this weight. So the way we define Elonis and tardiness is that we if if a if a certain job is early. So if a certain drop is early, it means that it finished processing before its due date. So if the due date is right here, deja, this is JJ and this is its completion time, C.J.. It means it finished early by a certain amount of E.J. and that amount is the difference, the positive difference between the due date and see, so we reverse the order of these two components. So I take that positive difference. If it is not early, I just assume that the airlines is zero. So it's it's if it's late or if it's on time, it is. It has a zero earlier amount. So it's the positive difference between due date and completion time while in the tardiness, as we just mentioned. [00:38:01:26] So this is for this case, for the case of tardiness, if Jay is here. But the due date happened to be here and this is the. So this is the due date and we happen to have the completion time here. C.j. That difference, as we just discussed, is the the tardiness, which is the positive difference between C.J. and D.J.. So you see that these are reversed. So an objective like this, we try to minimize this penalty by trying to complete the jobs as close as possible to their to their due date. So in non-regular objectives, as the completion time increases, the objective function decreases. For a certain over a certain period of time and then if we pass that due date, the tardiness will take over and you start seeing a penalty for tardiness. So maybe these figures will actually help you imagine what's going on with regular versus non-regular objective functions. So in case of, for instance, lateness or tardiness or a number of tardy jobs, as you can see as CGI increases, the objective function just keeps going up as time passes by the same thing here, we should expect something that goes up like this. And maybe if you have more of these due dates being missed, you would see another step function to two and you'd see you end up with something that will never actually go down the same thing with tardiness. [00:39:36:04] It's either stays the same or goes up while in practice or in case of nonregular objective functions. Usually you will see a decline in the cost because it's not a good idea to produce a job very early. And once it keeps declining until you get very close to the due date, and then it will start going up an industry that's common to have many industries, it's common to have this objective functions. And but you can think of maybe the food industry as one of the best examples where it's never a good idea to produce food too early before its due date because the the food goes bad. So, for instance, it's not a good idea to have to produce milk very early, because then it gets it goes bad and there is a penalty for that. Once you pass this duty, then this penalty becomes being late to your customers. So think of the penalty before the due date as the cost of carrying jobs and inventory or the cost of throwing process jobs because they went bad because of the extended period of time. And think of anything after the due date as being late to the customers. Here are some examples of how we use this notation. If you see a notation like this, if you see a one c max, well, this means that I have a single machine scheduling problem. [00:41:10:03] I have set up times that are sequence dependent as IG, and my objective function is to minimize the make spend. Here's another example. Pm nothing in between that's empty field and then C Max that tells me I have a parallel, identical parallel machines because we said I parallel machines that are identical. We refer to them as p uniform. Their Q and unrelated. There are. And I don't have any restrictions, which means that all jobs are available at time zero. And my objective function is to minimize also the extent. Another example of a flow shop where you have floor shop with machines, so you may have equal to two or three or four, depending on how many machines you have, you have released times for the jobs, which means that a job. Not all jobs are available at time zero. They have certain early start time. They there are certain times that associated with each job where you cannot start before this time, so it is available time. In other words, break down machines can break down. So that is considered in the model in this case, and the objective function is to minimize the total wasted tardiness. So this is. So now, instead of using an extended description for the problem, using simple notation like this can tell you what the problem is and what, what the environment is, what the constraints or restrictions are and what the objective function is.",7912,"[-0.01386356 -0.01972579 -0.01322724 ...  0.00529699  0.00194787

There are many objectives and scheduling problems, depending on the situation you're dealing with, and almost all objectives are a function of the completion times or equivalently the start times. Because if you know the completion times you subtract the processing time for a certain job, you will get the start time or the other way around you. If you know the start time, you add to it the processing time you will get their completion times, it's more common to see. Although you see some start times used in the literature, it's more common to see completion times. Among the most common objectives are the mix span, the maximum lateness, the weighted number of tardy jobs, the total completion time, the total weighted tardiness, total weighted elements and tables. Now we discussed the these objectives in more detail earlier and they and the situations in which we would use them. And here we will just go over the way we calculate them by the use of an example. In this example, suppose that you are given a certain sequence of jobs one two three four five six seven of seven jobs that have the following information The weights for the seven jobs are given here WJ. The processing times are given. And the due dates are given below here, and what we want to do here is to calculate the values of the different objective functions that you see listed here, starting with the mic span. So it's important to note here that by calculating the objective function, we are not really solving the problem. [00:02:02:18] We are merely taking a sequence and calculating the corresponding objective function value for a certain objective. We are not really figuring out the best sequence or the best assignment of jobs. So this is just for practice purposes where if you if we already know the sequence, we know how to calculate the objective function value. So let's take the a notepad and perform these calculations manually, and you can follow step by step what we are doing. So remember that the problem gives us here the sequence. So the sequence is already given, and we just want to calculate the objective function values. So the sequence is one two three four five six seven. And for that sequence. If I if I want to calculate the completion times, I need the processing times. So the processing time for job one is three right here. So this. Distance, or this time is three, then four drop to its six and four job, three, it is also six for job, five for job for its five. For Job five, it's for four jobs, six, it's eight and four job seven. It's nine. So these are the processing times from which we can calculate the completion time. So the completion time since this is assuming, assuming we're starting at time zero, the completion time for job one is three. The completion time for Job two is three plus six, which is equal to nine. Because this job has to wait for job one since we have a single machine job to has to wait for job one first, so it's completion time. [00:04:07:20] The job, once completion time is three now, Job two will wait for that three. So now three time units passed by. Add to it the processing time of Job two that will give you the completion time of job to the completion time of Job three is. C3, which is nine completion time of job two plus six. This gives us 15. And similarly, you do the rest of them for job four. It's 20 and four. Job five. It is 24 for job. 24 for Job six. It is 32. And for job seven, it is forty one. The due dates, as given here for each job, is as follows the one is equal to five and the two is equal to 10. So it will be somewhere here. So the two is 10. And. So that's D2, D3 is 15, so it will be exactly matching the completion time. The four is twenty. The five is 25. So it will be the will be right here. The five is 25 and the six is 30, so it will be here somewhere. This X is equal to 30 and the seven is 35. So the seven. Is thirty five. Which means it will be somewhere here. These seven equals. Maybe, actually. Closer to here. Okay, and we already we also know the weights for the different jobs as given by this roll over here. Now if I want to, let's say, calculate the make span. [00:06:36:28] C-max is basically the maximum of C1 C2 all the way to see a C7. See, seven. And as we said, see one is equal to the processing time plus zero because we're starting at time zero. So that will be equal to the processing time and it will be equal to three and C2 as we just described it in the. They figure about it will be C1 plus P2, which is equal to three plus six and it's equal to nine and so on for all of them. Now keep in mind that if the order wasn't in sequence like one two three four, it was maybe four three two one something like this. We will take the completion time of a job is the completion time of the previous job, plus the processing time of the current job. So it doesn't have they don't have to be in sequence. The C max is the maximum of all of these. Maximum of three, six, six, No. Three. Nine. 15 20. The completion time for Job five is 24 and. Thirty two and forty one. So the maximum of all of these is 41. No, that this problem, regardless of how you order the jobs, the C-Max would remain 41. So it's the summation of all processing times and it will not change for this problem is trivial for the objective function of the C-MAX because you have to do these assignments, these tasks and they take a certain amount of processing regardless which order you put them in, especially that we don't have any. [00:08:46:00] We don't have any set up times, so they see Max would remain the same regardless of the sequence. So now if I want to calculate, I just copied this picture over so that we always we use it to help us with the calculations. If I calculate the objective function of the MAX, which is number two here, L Max. Is the maximum of all the witnesses? All the way to L7 and L1 is equal to C one minus the one which is equal to three minus five. That's a minus two, which means that that the this first job is early. It's a negative lateness. L2 is C two minus D two. The completion time for second job is nine minus 10, so it's one unit early. L3 is 15 minus 15, which is equal to zero. L four is also zero and five is minus one. Because the completion time of Job five is 24 and its due date is 25 and L six. You can verify this yourself. Al.6 is two and L7 is six as well. So these are the amounts of likenesses and ill max. I will take the old max the maximum of all of these value. It will be equal to six to four that sequence. For that particular sequence, the MAX is equal to six. If I change the sequence, this max will most likely change. Now. Keep in mind that I will go back to this particular calculation whenever we talk about airlines, because these values can also help us decide which jobs are early and how by how much airlines we how much the airlines for each job is. [00:11:04:01] Ok, so let's now calculate another objective, which is the weighted tardiness. And the way the tardiness, if you recall, so number three is the weighted tardiness. Where we will add up the weight by the amount of tardiness for each job from a job equal to one to seven. And basically the way tardiness is defined as the maximum of zero and the positive difference from the due date. C.j. minus. Minus. Ok. And so you can think of this as just the positive. Positive lateness. Ok, the positive lateness. So if I calculate this for if I go back to the latest calculations, it means that I want to know that positive difference. I want to know that positive difference. Only when the jobs are laid, so in this case, all of the four, the four one two three four five jobs, the first five jobs are early, while the second and the last two are tardy. So the total tardiness is two by two and six. Keep in mind that the we need to multiply this, by the way, because this is the way that tardiness. So if jobs six and seven. Or thirdly, it means that I need to multiply them by the corresponding tardiness by 17 and 16, so the amount of total tardiness. Ok, so total tardiness, the summation of WJ, T.J. will be in this case equal to 17 by two plus 16 or set to be consistent six by 16, six by 16, and that gives me 130. [00:13:21:01] Now to calculate the to calculate the another objective function. Let's say the total completion time, so the fourth one. Is the total weighted completion time for all jobs? So in this case, we will take the completion time of each job and multiply it by its weight and then add them up, and that will become our objective function. And the rationale here is that you're trying to minimize the total time these jobs they spend in the system. So the completion time of the first job is this amount over here, the completion time of the second job. Nine. It's this amount here. The completion time of the third job is the amount that will include both jobs one and two. So the previous processing times will be added up. And to calculate the value of the objective function, multiply it by. By the way, it will be eight. The wait for job one. The wait for job one right here multiplied by its completion time, which is three plus. They wait for job to 12, multiplied by nine plus eight by 15 plus eight by 20 plus. Eight by twenty four. Plus 17 by 32 plus, 16 by forty one and that will be 18. Eighteen or four? The value of the objective function. Now, taking the objective function of, let's say, the total weighted number of tardy jobs, which is the summation of WGA, huge where huge is a binary variable equals to one if a job is tardy and zero if not so it will be from one to seven. [00:15:30:23] Basically, if I go back to this picture, if you look at all of these jobs, job one is early because this is its due date and this is its completion time and job two is early. Job three is on time. Job four is on time. Job five is early. The due date for Job five is 25. While it's completion, time is. 24. So that's a 24 and job of six and seven are tardy because the completion time for Job six is 32, while it's due date is 30, so it's tardy and Job seven is tardy. So we have to count of 30 jobs. And keep in mind that in UJA, we just count how many jobs are tardy and we multiplied by the the weight. So in this case, it will be one multiplied by 17, which is the weight class one by 16. And that is equal to. Oh, three. So the amount of total wasted number of tardy jobs is equal to three. Another objective can be the early innocent tardiness minimizing the illness and tardiness. So I'm trying to minimize the wasted. Um. Hurling is plus the weighted tardiness. From Jay Equal one to seven. And this objective function helps to minimize the inventory cost or holding cost and also minimize the cost of being late to the customers. So in this case, if you recall from the lateness calculations, if I go all the way back to the ill max calculations, we calculated the lateness for each one of them. [00:17:29:19] So that's lateness. The negative lateness is equivalent to the airlines because you take the the the due date minus their completion time. We can do it again here just to make sure. So if I want to calculate the airlines and let's assume for now, suppose that suppose that the wait for the penalty for being early is equal to the penalty for being late and it's equal to one. In other words, the cost of holding an item in inventory is equivalent to being late to one customer. If this is not typical typically the case, but for simplicity, let's just assume this if it is not this, then it may be double. So it may alpha may be one and better will be two and so on. Just for our purposes, we just need to demonstrate how to calculate the objective. The airline is for the first job is to because you are the completion time. So the airline is the the. If I want to really lay it out, it will be the difference between five minus three multiplied by one. Plus plus, the second job is early by one unit, because here I have nine, my completion time is nine. And due date is 10, so it will be 10 minus nine. Multiplied also by one, plus the ugliness of Job three, which is 15 and the completion time of Job three is 15, so it will be zero, so it will be 15 minus 15 plus job for the completion time is 20 and the due date is 20, so it will be 20 minus 20 plus job. [00:19:15:16] Five is early as well. It is 25 minus 24. Now it's time to do the tardy jobs. The number six is tardy by two units, so I have the completion time now I reverse here. I was doing a due date minus completion time. Ok, now in this case, it will be completion time minus due date so that I get the positive difference only so it will be 32 minus 30 and. The completion timeline is the due date, plus the completion time here is 41 minus 35, so this will give me two plus one plus zero plus zero plus one. Plus, two plus six, so this will be eight, nine, 10, 12, the total amount of ugliness and third. So basically we took these common objective functions and calculated them for a certain for a given sequence. And the the whole approach is very simple and straightforward. As long as you calculate the the completion times correctly, then everything is based off of the values of the completion times. There are other objectives, but when you are when, when you are faced with another situation that requires another objective, the calculation will be based on that objective, which is most likely will be a function of the completion time. So that was just an exercise on calculating completion times.",3466,"[-0.00308308 -0.01500912 -0.00386837 ... -0.00738848 -0.01171777

Complexity of Scheduling Problems,10.4,OS,"Title: Complexity of Scheduling Problems; Description: Complexity of Scheduling Problems; Transcript: [00:00:01:10] Let's discuss now the complexity of scheduling problems. We will use a problem known as the traveling salesman problem as an example to explain how complex scheduling problems can be in this problem. Traveling salesman problem or the TSP. A salesman must visit and cities certain number of cities. Each city must be visited only once, so that salesman cannot come back to the to a visited city. And the problem that we are trying to solve is to determine which path the salesman should take to minimize the total distance traveled. So we are trying to find the shortest tour for a complete tour for that traveling salesman. In this case, the distance can represent the cost. So the cost can be can be the travelling time. There can be fuel costs can be the airline cost, whatever it is that will cost whatever it is, that will cost the person to go from point A to point B. Depending on the application, this problem has actually a lot of applications, and it is among the most famous problems in the area of operations research and many, many people working on this problem. And it has been used as a benchmark problem. So the again, the issue here is assuming that the traveling salesman will start from a certain point non-point. Let's say this this city here. One way to to visit all the other cities is to go to follow this path. And the distance between City and City B or City Iron CDG is the IG, and it represents the cost, so this cost can be the number of miles it can be. [00:01:51:07] The fuel cost can be the airline ticket cost can be the time it takes to go from one point to another. And the objective is to find a tool that will minimize the total travel cost without revisiting any of the cities. So is this a good path to take, or probably this is a better path to take the red path? Another possibility is this is this path. So the question is, how many possibilities do we have, how many tours do we have? And the answer to this is a lot. We have we have many combinations. So if we take the simple example of four cities where we have four cities only and we are given the distances between them or the cost, in this case, it's the distances. And so the distance for going from city one to city two is ten. From one to three is 20. The distance from two to one is 15 and from two to three is 35 and so on. So this is asymmetric, asymmetric traveling salesman problem. If I had. The RGA equal to DJI, meaning the distance from one to two is the same as the distance from two to one. Then the problem will become the symmetric traveling salesman problem. So how many combinations do we have, how many possibilities do we have for this example, for this example? This simple example, you can pause at this point and try to think about it and come up with the number of combinations or permutations for the traveling salesman. [00:03:46:01] Let's try to enumerate the number of possibilities, so assuming that the starting city is city one and it's known beforehand, the salesman can go from one to two three four, then come back to one. Another possibility would be to go from one to two for three, then back to one and another one would be one three two four one one three. Four, two one. One for. Two, three, one. And finally, one four three two one. So as you can see, the number of permutations in this case will be in terms of the number of cities so as the number of cities. And in this case, it will be, in fact, because I know the first city it will be in minus one factorial. So in this case, it will be four minus three four minus one. Four minus one factorial, which is equal to three factorial. And this is equal to six. And assuming I have asymmetric data, meaning going from one to two is not the same as going from two to one. If I had symmetric data. Well, symmetric travelling salesman, so in other words, if the idea is equal to the. J.i. The number of possibilities. So this is the number of tours, the number of tours. Is going to be an minus one. Divided by two. So in this case, it will be three possibilities. And how do we reflect this on the in these permutations that we just created? Basically, it becomes that going from one to two, then two to three three to four four back to one is the same as this last permutation, which is one to two two to three three to four four to one because I have the same distance between one and two as two to one. [00:06:13:27] So these two permutations? These two permutations are actually equivalent if I have the same distances, the IG equal to DJI. And in the second case, the second permutation if I have here one two four three one, it will be equivalent to this permutation of one three four two one. And finally. And finally, so these are equivalent. And these two are equivalent, and finally, the the remaining ones one, three, four. One three, two four one is the same as one four two three one as if you go in the reverse direction, so these will be equivalent. So the number of permutations that need to be evaluated gets cut in half. This is why I divide in minus one divide. Divide it by two. However, actually reducing the number of permutations by half doesn't really help a whole lot when n is large because n factorial is a very large number as end becomes larger and the complexity of the problem remains the same. To understand the significance and the complexity of this search space and how huge it is, the the. So I have here the number of permutations, and suppose that if I have a computer that will evaluate a thousand solutions every second, meaning I can measure the distance for a whole tour, one tour, 1000 of them in one second or each tour will be evaluated in one millisecond. [00:08:09:17] If that's the case, and as the number of cities increases to from four to 10 to 12 to 17, what happens with the number of amount of computation? If I have a computer that evaluates a thousand solutions per second, meaning a thousand tours for the traveling salesman per second? If I have a small number like six cities, it will take only a fraction of a second. As I have more cities like eight cities to take five seconds, not too bad 10 cities, six minutes 12 cities, 11 hours, 14 cities, 72 days, 16 cities, forty one years. And then you get into actually thousands, millions of years, billions of years, millions of years. If you go up to 24 24 cities and you can do this calculation by yourself, you can calculate compute the number of permutations for a certain size. Let's say for size 10, you take this number divided by a thousand that will give you the number of seconds that is needed. You can divide that by the then calculate the number of minutes and so on. So then you say, well, maybe this 2000 solution per second is not fast enough, and now we have computers that are much faster than this. So let's assume that instead of a thousand solution per second, we evaluate a million solutions per second or in some cases, actually 10 to the power nine solutions per second. [00:09:42:11] So, in other words, let a solution be evaluated at one microsecond in the second column or one nanosecond in the third column. So what happens as I increase the size of the problem instead of taking 819 billion years for a 24 city problem using this first computer? If I have a faster computer, it will take eight 19 million years, much less than eight 19 billion years. Still, we can't wait that long for to solve a 24 city problem. And even if we once we increase actually this number by two cities, only this number in millions will be go back to billions anyway. So as you can see the search space, we call this the search space. We the search space for problems like this and this is a scheduling problem becomes very huge. And finding the optimal solutions cannot be done by enumerating all possibilities. Enumerating all possibilities takes a significant amount of time, significant amount of memory computer memory that is impossible to follow, and you can do it only for very small problem sizes. What we need is more intelligent methods to find solutions for the point that we want to make here is that for this kind of problems like the DSP, as the problem size increases by a little bit linearly, the computational, the number of combinations and the computational time increases exponentially. So as you go from as you saw in this graph, as you go from, let's say, 14 cities to 16 cities, you go from 72 days to forty one years because the nature of the factorial numbers or number of combinations, the factorial number of combinations. [00:11:36:07] So as you increase the city size just by one or two, the computational, the number of combinations and therefore the the computational time becomes significantly higher. And this kind of problems are classified as ENPPI problems. So we classify optimization problems, combinatorial problems into two main classes, tractable problems and intractable problems. We refer to tractable problems as PE and the intractable problems as NP, where NP means non deterministic polynomial time algorithm. What this means that if a problem falls here. And the NPY category, such as the traveling salesman problem, there isn't really a known. Algorithm that can find the solution quickly in polynomial time. We don't we have not determined if there is a polynomial time algorithm that can solve it fast enough. Ok. However, if the problem is easy and we can find a polynomial time algorithm to find it in a short period of time, then it will fall into this class of problems. So if you hear the term, if you hear the term MP complete or NP hard problem, it means that this problem is has a lot of combinations and I need an enumeration plan or algorithm or a something like branch and band algorithm or a branch and cut algorithm, something that will actually get me enumerate the cases do some enumeration to find to guarantee optimal solutions. [00:13:20:00] And we we cannot really find an optimal solution for such problems in an easy way. You have to enumerate, you have to think about multiple possibilities. That doesn't mean that we have to enumerate all possibilities. They are smart methods like a branch and band where certain you still have to enumerate. But you can eliminate a lot of possibilities by cutting down on some or some areas in the search space. For the scope, for the scope of our class, what we want to recognize is that certain problems they are and problems and they are difficult to solve and therefore we cannot find optimal solution with approximate methods or holistic methods or simple rules. So these problems that are known as in part or NP complete, they belong to this class of problems where there is a lot of enumeration and. We also learn from this is that they enumerating all the possibilities is not an option and we need a smarter way of finding optimal solutions. And in some cases, though, for some scheduling problems, most of scheduling problems fall into the NP complete and NP hard. The NP class of problems but in some cases, for some problems, we may be able to find a polynomial search algorithm that is of the order of N to the power to or RN or three end or end to the power three. Anything that's polynomial that runs and as a function of the problem size can find solutions and search and polynomial. [00:15:00:04] Number of steps are known as polynomial functions or polynomial algorithms. And that is good news because then you can find the the the solution quickly. But if you have problems with the search space of two to the power and or in factorial, anything where MN is in the exponent is considered difficult problems because it has a lot of combinations and the search space becomes grows exponentially as you increase the problem size linearly and there will be no way for the computer industry to catch up with the growth of the problem. So the computer industry increases the speed of the processors in a linear fashion. So this year, the the speed of the processor is twice as much of last year or next year. It will be double the speed, but you're still going in linear terms. You are increasing the speed by two or three or four folds. It's still a linear increase, while the problems as you increase them linearly, they will grow exponentially. And as you could see, even with computers that can find solutions at one nanosecond per solution, they are still not good enough whenever the problem size becomes larger. Now, polynomial algorithms are much more reasonable or tractable for computation, because just by looking at a polynomial algorithm like this one and square, you know that it will be, it will it will take less computational time than something like two to the power anywhere.

Single Machine Scheduling Problems,10.5,OS,"Title: Single Machine Scheduling Problems; Description: Single Machine Scheduling Problems; Transcript: [00:00:02:00] In this module, we cover single machine scheduling problems and methods. Let's start with this simple problem of a single machine. One no restrictions and the objective function of minimizing the total completion time. And if you recall, we use an objective like this whenever we are trying to minimize the amount of time the orders or the jobs or the clients or the customers they spend in the system. For this problem, it turns out that the shortest processing time first rule is optimal for this problem, so a very simple rule is actually optimal for this problem. And the way this rule works is it starts with the job that has the shortest processing time and process at first on the machine, followed by the next or the second shortest processing time. And then the third shortest processing time and so on. In other words, if you sort the jobs or you order them by processing time, then that will be an optimal order from smallest to largest. With respect to the total completion time, it is not optimal in general. It is optimal only when a single machine, no restriction and a total completion time is the objective. So let's take an example to show you how we calculate the total completion time for a certain sequence. And suppose that we have four jobs and they're processing times are 10 for Job one 24. Job two, three, four, job three and forty four job four. If I'm given a certain sequence, let's suppose that this sequence is one to three for the total completion time would be starting with job one first. [00:01:50:18] This is a Gantt chart only for a single machine, but it's broken down to show you waiting time and processing time. So we start with Job one first, which has 10 units of processing and it will complete a time. 10. And then. Job to. Follows, but job two doesn't start until time 10 and. This time, 10 units, while you're processing job one, job two is waiting, job three is waiting, job four is waiting. So now once we're done with job one, we start Job two. It takes 20 units of processing. Then Job three can start, and then finally, Job four can start and finish at 100. Therefore, if I calculate the total completion time, I will take the completion time of every job and add them up, so it will be 10 plus 20 plus 60 for job three plus one hundred. That gives me a total of 200. Don't confuse this with adding up just the processing times because adding up the processing times will give me only the mixed pan. At the time, necessary to process all jobs, only processing time, not waiting time, so the notation that I'm using here or the the way I do this figure is that the solid blocks they represent processing times while the blank ones they represent waiting time. So the total completion time is an objective that contains both waiting and processing. So for all jobs, it's two hundred and also minimizing the this objective total completion time is the same as effectively the same as minimizing the average waiting time. [00:03:34:23] So if you want to say I want to minimize the average waiting time for the customers, that would be the objective function to consider. And it is equivalent because if I divide this by RN or by the number of jobs it's like, as if I'm dividing by a constant, it doesn't affect the final final sequence or the final schedule. It may affect their objective function value, but not the sequence. Keep also in mind that this example here shows the calculation for a given sequence one two three four. And this is how we calculated it and what you need to come up with for a certain scheduling problem is this sequence. This is not a solution for the problem. This is a calculation of the objective function value. They are the solution to the problem is to come up with with the sequence, whether it's optimal or just good sequence for the problem, and then you evaluate the objective function. So this was just an example of how you calculate the objective function. It happened to be in this case, sorted from shortest processing time to longest processing time. So in fact, this solution is in fact. Optimal for single machine total completion time problem, because it follows the SBT rule, where I start with the shortest processing time, followed by the second shortest, third shortest and so on. [00:05:00:20] So if since the jobs are already sorted, they speed. If basically, if you order them as from one to four, that was an empty order and that is optimal for this problem. Let's now consider. Similar problem, but the objective is to. Minimize the waited. Short, they waited a total completion time. Weighted total completion time. In other words, the jobs they have penalties for staying in the system that differ from one to another. So in this case are also this is an easy problem because the way the shortest processing time rule is optimal. And what we need to do to use this role is to calculate the ratio between the weights to the processing times and then order it from largest to smallest or in decreasing order. And that will give me the optimal solution. So let's take this example, where I have certain weights for seven jobs, different weights and processing time, different processing time for seven jobs, if I can. And if and suppose that I'm trying to minimize this objective function, which is the weighted completion time. In other words, the penalty for keeping, let's say, job one for one time unit in the system, it is eight dollars. While the penalty of keeping Job two in the system, it's twelve dollars. So clearly the higher the weight, the higher the penalty. And therefore you want to get rid of the jobs that have high weights early on, but you also want to get rid of the jobs that they have shorter processing time early on because otherwise the short the short jobs will keep waiting for the long jobs and they stay longer in the system and the cost will be higher. [00:07:07:13] The method to accomplish this is if you take the issue between W.J. to PJ, because this is the rationale here is that higher weights, it means more cost. So you want to give them higher priority and you want to process them faster. So WGA is WGA is the wait for the cost for per job and the higher the sway, the higher the penalty. So you want to process them faster. And so the higher the the W, the higher this ratio. Also, when you have a smaller processing time p the smallest, the smaller the processing time, the higher the priority should be for this objective function because it reduces the waiting time, and it would that would reduce the objective function. So when we divide by a small number, this ratio will become higher. So both of them both factors. Actually, drive the getting rid of larger weights, jobs with larger weights and shorter, shortest processing times first. So by taking this ratio, it has been proven that the optimal solution the solution obtained is optimal. So if I calculate the ratio between W.J. to PGA for job one, you get two point sixty seven 12 divided by six will give you two and so on for all of them. Now, if you order the jobs in none increasing order, meaning the largest first, then the next the smaller and smaller and smallest, you will end up with the optimal solution for that particular objective. [00:08:48:14] So if I take the ratio between W.J. to PGA, I get this. I get these numbers and. They order the optimal order is to take the largest ratio, which is two point sixty seven first, followed by the next largest, which is two point thirteen, then followed by the next one, which is two or. To over here, which is Job five, so I can either pick this one or that one arbitrarily, they both have the same priority level. And this is why I have two optimal solutions in this example, followed by one point sixty one point seventy eight four job seven, then followed by one point six and one point three for jobs four and three. And the reason I have two optimal solutions here is because I could have picked two, followed by five or five, followed by two, and they're both optimal and they both should have the same objective function value. As an exercise, I would like you to calculate the objective function value this is the optimal order, but to calculate the objective function value, you need to calculate the completion times for these jobs in this order. So you put the jobs in order of one to one two one six two. Five, seven, four three and then calculate the completion times and from that, calculate calculate the total weighted. Multiply the weighted. [00:10:22:05] Complete the weights by the completion times and add up all of the completion times. Let's take another problem. In which we have a single machine and objective function is to calculate to minimize the the maximum latency, the maximum lateness, the lateness is defined as the difference between completion time and due date. It can be positive or negative. And when I minimize the maximum lateness, I'm trying not to be extremely late for one of the jobs. It's OK to be late by a little bit for every job, but I don't want what I'm trying, what I'm interested in is not to be extremely late for one of their jobs. This problem is also easy and the earliest due date rule is optimal, meaning if you order the job by their due dates from smallest to largest and you order them in that way, you end up with an optimal solution for this particular objective function for a single on a single machine. So, for instance, if I have these jobs, seven jobs and I have there, these are the duties all what I need to do is to order the jobs by their due date. So the smallest job, the smallest due date is two. So that goes first, followed by the next smallest, which is seven for Job four and then followed by eight, which is job one, followed by job six, seven, two and five. This is an optimal order, and you can calculate for that. The maximum late, not that the optimal solution doesn't even have to consider the processing times of the jobs as long as you know the due date for the jobs, regardless how long each job is, the order of earliest due date first is optimal for this particular problem and this particular objective function. [00:12:33:12] You can calculate the value of the objective function if you assume that the processing times are similar to the previous example over here, so you can take these processing times and consider them the processing time for the next example. And since, you know. The due dates for each job, you can always calculate the completion time, take the difference between the completion time and the due date, and then calculate the lateness and you can calculate the maximum lateness for this order and that will be the optimal value. Now, let's consider another problem where you have the same environment, single machine. You have the same objective function. Max or maximum lateness. But you also have a restriction that not all jobs are available at time zero. So we have release time or availability time for each job that's given to us in this table. So if I have three jobs, one two three, I have the processing times for each job, I have the available time or the release time for each job. This means that job one is available at time zero, but Job two is not available until time three and then Job three is available at time five. These are the due dates for each job. [00:13:55:14] If I apply the earliest due date first for this problem, you will take the smallest due date, which is eight for job one and you start with it first. This job has processing time of four units, so you will complete it at time. For the next smallest date is actually job three. With due date of 10, however, Job three is not available until time five. So I cannot effectively start actually processing this. So since Job three is not available, however, Job two is available, it became available at time. Three right here. Right here for Job two, if I could just pick up Job two instead, since Job three is not there yet and I start with job to finish job two and the meantime, a time 10 when I complete job to job three became available at time. Five. Job three became available at time five, and so I can process it after job two to calculate the MAX. It will be the maximum for this order of one to three, which is the ad order. I will calculate them latencies for each one of these jobs and take the maximum. And the lateness for each job is the difference between the completion time and the due date. If I take job one, the completion time for job one is four right here minus its due date. Is it the one for job two, the completion time is 10. And the due date for job two is 14, so Job two is early, and so it will be early by four units and Job one is early by four units. [00:15:55:06] However, Job three. Is the completion time is 15, while the due date is actually 10. So it was late by five, the maximum of all of these is five. When I take the maximum, it's not like I'm maximizing, I'm just finding the order that will minimize the ill max. So the ill max is the maximum of all latencies. So that's how I evaluate the objective function I'm not trying to maximize. I'm in fact trying to minimize. So I'm trying to figure out the order that will make this value of five as small as possible. The value of the ill max is as small as possible. If I can find another order that will give me a lower value than five, then that would be a better order for this problem. So can we really improve this solution? Consider the following. If I start with job one just as before. It's available at time zero, I started with it and it completes a time for then instead of since Job three is not available until time five. Instead of starting with Job two, I will delay the schedule. I'll just wait until Job three becomes available. So at that point, Job three can start that time five and you can process four five units and then load job two, and it will finish at times 16. So it is true that I was that my C-Max here is 16 instead of 15. [00:17:30:24] However, if you look at the maximum at the maximum completion time for this order, adding the delay here L1 will be the completion time of job one minus its due date. So no change there. It's early by four units because this is the due date for job one, job three, the completion time is 10 and its due date is 10. So I have a lateness of zero. And finally, job to the completion time is 16 and the due date is 14. So I have a lateness of two and the maximum of all of these is two. So I did improve this solution. Instead of using the HDD rule, I used a more of, I included the delay and that gave me a better solution. Now it's not easy really to especially for larger problems. It's not easy to figure out how much delay to put between all the jobs you have with a with a simple rule. So for that, you need a more sophisticated algorithm, a new narrative type of algorithms known as the branch unbound algorithms to find the optimal solution for this problem. It takes more time to find optimal solutions. It's not. It's it's an iterative process. It's a it's a it's an algorithm that can take depending on the problem. Size can take a thousands or millions of possibilities. So we need to enumerate and eliminate some of the solutions that they don't make sense until we have our optimal solution. [00:19:06:04] So this problem is actually known to be a hard problem. So this problem is known to be hard problem, this is why we need a branch, an algorithm to find optimal solution. There is no easy rule like the SBT or the LPT rule or the ED rule to to find the optimal solution. This problem is hard problem. It belongs to the NP class of problems and you need more of an enumeration algorithm to find it, such as branch and bound to find the optimal solution. If I take the same problem with the release times, but I include the preemption. Meaning. It's acceptable to stop a certain job, start another one, then go back and complete the job that you just start. Similar to what you do when you multitask. You're doing something. You stop, you do something else, then you come back to the task you are doing. That's called the preemption. If I allow for preemption. With the exact same problem with release times, then the preemptive rule is optimal for this problem. So again, if I include preemption, this problem comes back to the PE class, meaning it becomes a an easy problem and the pre-emptive HDD rule is optimal. So how does the preemptive rule work? Have the same problem, but I allow preemption the exact same data, but I allow preemption. So if I order the jobs by added, I will start with job one, which you see right here and there is and it has the earliest jobs, so the earliest you date. [00:20:55:05] So I finish job one, then the the priority is to job three, according to Eddie. But Job three is not available. In the meantime, I can start with Job two. Which is already available at times three, and I can process two units of job two until Job three becomes available. So I stopped Job two, I process Job three, all of it because it has more priority in terms of due date than Job two. And then then I will put job two back on the machine and finish it. So in this order, this is a schedule that will allow preemption where, as you can see here, we took we processed one unit of Job two and then we finished the rest of it after we processed Job three. So in this case, if you calculate the lateness just like before, you will end up with the maximum lateness of one, and that's considered a lower bound for the problem without preemption. In other words, if you don't have if you have a problem where preemption is not allowed and you solve the problem with preemption exact same data, the solution would be always less than or equal to the solution for the problem without preemption, and that's used in branch and band algorithm as a lower bound to help eliminate some of the possibilities, which is a little beyond the scope of this this course. But just for you to know that this is considered a lower bound for the problem without preemption to the objective function will always be less than or in the best case scenario, it would be equal to the problem with preemption. [00:22:36:14] And it can be used as a lower bound in different algorithms. So in summary, what we presented here is a couple of objectives on a single machine and a couple of methods to solve them just to demonstrate that some of these scheduling problems are easy to solve and they can be solved with simple rules like the shortest processing time first or the weighted shortest processing time rule, or the earliest due date rule, while some others they they require more sophisticated algorithms because they belong to the NP class problem, and there isn't really an easy way to find a solution, the optimal solution. But these methods as well they can provide you with reasonable solutions not necessarily optimal for the difficult problems, and they can be used to find the solution. So, for instance, the ID rule in this. In this problem, although it's not optimal, it can be a reasonable rule to use with this with this problem, and you can it may find you reasonable solutions, but it doesn't guarantee optimality. However, they in this case this rule. The pre-emptive ED is, in fact optimal if this if you're dealing with this problem or you're trying to solve this problem as a lower bound for the more difficult, for the more difficult problem.",4293,"[-0.01300757 -0.01282388 -0.00445945 ...  0.00050938 -0.01566079

Flowshop Scheduling Problems,10.7,OS,"Title: Flowshop Scheduling Problems; Description: Flowshop Scheduling Problems; Transcript: [00:00:01:23] Let's take now another scheduling model, the flowshop Scheduling Problem. In flowshops, the machines are connected serially like this. Where the jobs will be fed into the system and they will go from one machine to the next and something like this can be a model that's used with assembly lines where the jobs will have to go, a job will have to go from one machine to the next, and some work will be done on the job until it's finished. And there are more than one type of flowshops, there is a permutation flow shop, in which the jobs keep the same order as they move from one machine to another. So if I feel the jobs as one, two, three into the first machine, they will keep the same order one, two, three going into machine two and one, two, three going into machine three and so on until machine M. [00:01:02:04] There are also models for the general flow shop in which the order of the jobs may change as they go from one machine to another. So if I input one, two, and three into the machine one as they go through machine one, they may have a different order. Possibly three, two, one going into Machine two, and so on. And there are more advanced models like the hybrid flowshops or flexible flowshops in which you may have at each stage, not one machine, but you may have parallel machines on each stage. We cover here a very basic model in which we have n jobs, we have m machines, as you see here. They have processing times, PIJ at the different machines, where I is the machine index and J is the job number. So P1J refers to the processing time of job J on machine one. This is the processing time of job J on machine two and so on. And then we will have, for instance, the processing time of job two on machine one that will be P12 and so on. And we finally may have a processing time of the last job on the last machine PMN. So each job has its own processing time on each machine. This is why we have this index, the processing time index in this way. So it's dependent not only on the job but also on the machine. [00:02:39:23] And suppose that we want to schedule the jobs so that we minimize the makespan a very common objective function in which you need to complete the jobs as soon as possible. Other objective functions are possible as well, but in this module, we will just focus on the makespan as an example of an objective function. For this type of problem, when we have two machines, so if I have a flowshop with two machines only, as you can see here, and the objective is to minimize the makespan. And suppose that we have unlimited buffer meaning between the machines so that the model we are looking at has only two machines, so M is equal to two and we have unlimited buffer in between. Which means if I finish jobs, processing jobs in machine one, they don't block the rest of the jobs once they get to machine two and suppose that they get a machine two and if you're not finished on machine two, they don't block the jobs moving from machine one. There is unlimited buffer in between these machines, so you can take the jobs of the machine and process as necessity. [00:03:46:00] In this case, Johnson's rule, or Johnson's algorithm, is a very famous rule that has been around for a while, and it is optimal for two machine flow shop model. When the objective function is the C-MAX, it's not optimal for other objective function, it's not optimal for more than one, for more than two machines. So it is optimal specifically for this kind of configuration and in this role, the way it works is that you partition the jobs into two sets. In set one, you include the jobs that have smaller processing time on machine one, then machine two. In the second set, you include the jobs that have longer processing time on machine one than machine two, and those that have the same processing time you can be assigned to either set. And then once we have that partitioning of jobs into these two sets, we order the jobs or we sequence them and set one in SPT order of the processing time in the first machine. And the second set in LPT order of the second machine, the processing time on the second machine. [00:05:09:16] And if there are any ties, we break them arbitrarily meaning it doesn't matter, you always get an optimal solution. So first, we partition the jobs into two sets the smaller processing times and machine one on one set with longer processing time then machine two and machine one and another set. And equal processing times can be assigned to either set. Then we order the jobs in SPT and then LPT of the respectively of these two sets one and two. [00:05:38:10] So let's take this example, where we have six jobs and the processing times of the first job on machine one is five. The first job on machine two is ten. The second job on machine one is three. The second job on machine two is one and so on for the rest of the jobs. So in this example, you have two machines, you have unlimited buffers and your objective function is to minimize the makespan on this flowshop. Now to find the optimal solution, we follow the algorithm Johnson's role where first, let's take a notepad. [00:06:33:07] So we have this kind of setup where you have two machines. And this is machine one, and this is machine two and you have six jobs coming through. So we first have set one, in which the processing time on machine one for any job is less than the processing time of machine tool of the jobs on machine two. [00:07:11:00] And if I go back to my data, as you can see, the jobs that are shorter in the first machine are labeled with red color. So one has five processing units on machine one and ten on machine two. Three has four and six, four and two, and three and six, one and five. They're all shorter on the first machine than the second machine. The blue jobs have longer processing time than machine one, three is longer than one, and eight is longer than two, and this would be the jobs in the second set. [00:08:03:23] So if I go to my notepad here, and this is the data here replicated. First, before I do my Gantt chart, let's create set one and set two. And this is just where I'm going to draw the Gantt chart to show the schedule, but if I am to go back here, I will. Set one will be then jobs one, three, four, and six, which have smaller processing times or shorter processing times than the second machine. So one, three, four, and six and set two, in which I have P1J is greater than P2J. In this set, I have jobs two and five, and once I have this order, once I have this assignment, the optimal sequence is going to be in an SPT-LPT for set one and set two. [00:09:41:08] So let's do this on the Gantt chart. So if I start with jobs, the jobs of the first set on machine one, remember that all jobs have to go through both machines. On machine one I will sequence them in SPT order and on machine two, I will sequence them in LPT order. So going to them, taking this first set one, three, four, six. If you look at the data one three, so let's label them, let's just use the red circles here. One, three, four, and six they belong to set one. So these are the set one jobs, and if I order them in SPT, I will have six, four, three, and one. Six has the shortest processing time, four the second shortest, three third shortest, and one last shortest. So I will have them ordered as six, four, three, one, if I do this on the Gantt chart, then starting with machine one, I will have a block that shows the processing of job six with one unit here. [00:11:10:23] So that's Job six and followed by job four, test processing time of two units on machine one. And then followed by job three that has four units, so something like this, followed by job one that has five units. So that would be six, four, three, one, and the completion times as you can imagine I have here one unit here I have, so I have a completion time of one. Maybe use the red color instead, the black color one. Job four has two units of processing time, two units right here on machine one. So that will make its completion time equal to three. Followed by job three which has four units of processing times, which means it will have a completion time of seven. And finally, job one has five units of processing time, which makes its completion time equal to twelve. [00:12:33:12] And now we turn our attention to the second set, which is two and five. So set two, so this is now set two and over here, we have our set one jobs. So set two, I have jobs five and two, and I will put them in LPT order. LPT meaning job five, followed by Job two because Job five has eight units and Job two has three units. So if I am to do, let's draw another block that shows job five, and suppose that these are eight units. I know it's not exactly to scale, but you get the idea. And then another three units. Ok, so that would be jobs five and two, and the completion times will be. For five, it will be twenty. And for two, it will be twenty-three because I have three units of processing here. [00:14:03:10] Now going to the second machine, going to the second machine. Now once we establish this order, so the order is SPT, LPT, as you see it here. Once we establish this order, the jobs are not going to change their position or their order, so they will once job six is finished on machine one, it will go down to machine two and it will process on machine two. On machine two, job six requires how many units of processing? It takes five units. So on machine two, it will take five units, so from one all the way to six. So that will be job six right here because it finished on machine one, then it will start on machine two. The starting time will be the completion time on machine one and needs five units of processing right here, five. So it will be complete at time six. So I have here this would be time six, followed by four will finish at time three. Then it needs how many units of processing and machine two? Job four will need three units of processing on machine two, which means that it will start at six and will finish at nine. [00:15:37:15] So if I have another square or block rectangle that represents that processing at nine. So that would be job four and it will complete at nine. It will complete at nine now, the next one will be job three, which will take on machine two six units. So on machine two, it will take six units, so Job three will finish all the way at fifteen. So all the way at fifteen, so that's job three. And followed by, the completion time for Job three would be fifteen right here, so that will be its completion time. And followed by job one, which on machine two, requires ten units, so job one will go all the way to twenty-three. So I will have again, this is not drawn to scale, exactly. But that's job one because it has, actually to twenty-five because it has ten units, it starts at time fifteen. Job one will start at time fifteen, because it will have to wait until job three is complete and then it will start, so it will go all the way to twenty-five, not twenty-three. [00:17:34:21] Finally, so now we have job one here, job one here now, jobs five and two. Job five will finish at time twenty, and it requires on machine two just two units of processing. So on machine two, I will draw a square, a rectangle with two units of processing, so that will be twenty-seven units, a completion time of twenty-seven. So that will be I'm going to use now the blue, the blue line. That would be job five and then finally job two requires one unit of processing, so it will be right here. So that job two will be here, and the completion time for it will be twenty-eight. The completion time for job five is twenty-seven and so on. [00:18:52:05] So the x-axis here represents my time and the makespan, the optimal makespan C-max is equal to twenty-eight. So what I want to point out is that this value of the C-Max is optimal, 28. However, you can find other orders other than Johnson's order of SPT, LPT order, that's optimal. So we may have more than one optimal order, but the optimal makespan will always be 28 for this data set. The Johnsons rule I have these ordered by the SPT rule, these jobs and the blue ones are ordered by the LPT job. And what I want to point out here is that you just worry about ordering them into the first machine. The second machine the order will come from the jobs that are coming out of the first machine, so if you notice here we enter Job six into the first machine, once it's completes, it goes down to the second machine and it starts processing. Job four, however, it completes at time three, but it doesn't have a space on Machine two because Machine two is busy processing Job six. It won't start until time six, so it is not uncommon in flowchart models to see actually Gantt charts that have some gaps in them because the machine may not be busy with doing anything. In other words, the processing on machine one, it's taking a long time where the second machine is sitting idle, doing nothing. [00:20:32:24] Anyway, in the case of two machines flowshop, two machine flow shop, the Johnson's order where you split the jobs in the way we just discussed to two sets and you order the sets in SPT-LPT order. Once you do this for the first machine, all the jobs have to be processed in the first machine, then all go down to the second machine. The second machine, you don't have to worry about how to sequence the jobs in SPT or LPT or anything they they will come out ordered in the way, in an optimal way based on the order that you feed into the first machine. So for instance, here Job five, it starts on Machine two and Machine one at 12, and then once it finishes, it will go down to Machine two. Now it will start whenever job one is complete at Machine two. It will start right here. So as you can see, Job five is not really doing anything in the meantime. Between 20 and 25, Job five is just waiting for Machine two to become available. If it was the other way around where a job is taking longer and in some other flowshop models, you may see some gaps where the machine is just sitting idle. Not the job sitting idle, the machine is sitting idle, waiting for the job to come, and therefore you may be able to see some gaps in the schedule. [00:21:52:28] So this completes our scheduling module. We covered only very few topics in scheduling. There are many other environments, many other objective functions, constraints, and processing restrictions that make the problem different and interesting. The literature is very rich with different types of problems that people worked on. I encourage you if you are interested to go out and look at some of the work that has been done in research papers and in scheduling, planning, and scheduling books. And the complexity of the problem and the solution methods applied to it can be vastly different depending on how difficult the problem is. So you will find a lot of exact methods like branch inbound and dynamic programming and this sort of algorithms. You also find some heuristics from greedy and simple heuristics to more complex enumeration type of algorithms, like branch and bound algorithms for more difficult problems. [00:22:59:09] So in conclusion, I don't want to leave you with the impression that we covered the whole area of scheduling. We just gave you a flavor of the area and there is a lot more to be learned. There are many other problems, types of problems, and different types of environments that are out there available. So if your problem that you're interested in it may match something that we didn't cover. You can always reach out to the literature and look at what other people have done on such problems.",3634,"[-0.02106086 -0.01698675 -0.02092551 ... -0.00098554 -0.00783015

Course Introduction and Design,1.0,PM,"Title: Course Introduction and Design; Description: Raphael Landaeta is the instructor for 604 Project Management and will be guiding students through the course. The course objectives include understanding and applying project management tools and methods, developing knowledge of project leadership from a system perspective, and demonstrating the ability to design and evaluate project management systems. The course will cover both fundamental and advanced project management concepts. The syllabus outlines the required textbook, additional readings, and the course project which involves planning a project. The course will also include quizzes and reflection activities.; Transcript: Hello and welcome to 604 Project Management. I'll be your instructor during these courses. When the recordings that you are going to get from this point on and my name is Raphael Landaeta and we are going to have fun during this course learning about project management and the goods and the uglies of what it is to be a project manager. So let's go to the presentation to. Understand how we're going to deal with this course and what are the expectations that we have, the structures we have from you and and what you expect from the course as well? In every class, in every learning module, you will find that there is a first slide with the title, and then there are the topics that are going to be covered in that learning module. In this case, we are covering the introduction to the course, the course designs, course approach, course requirements, a little bit of distance education, and then we get into the objectives of that learning module. In this case is the discuss high level integration of topics in the course design, understand conceptual approach to treatment of project management, recognize requirements and expectations needed for successful completion of the course. What are the course objectives of six and four project management? The first one is to understand and apply the fundamental tools and methods of project management. Then develop knowledge of concepts and methods in the leadership of projects from a system perspective. Perform conceptual design, planning and scheduling for a technical project.

Develop knowledge to understand, assess and resolve human technical administrative issues for deployed projects. Demonstrate capability to design, analyze and evaluate project management systems in a technical environment. And the most important of all, we need to have fun by doing all this. And I'll help you through the semester with my lecture so that you can actually develop that knowledge that any skills that you need to become a successful project manager. So the first thing that we're going to do is go through the syllabus, which is kind of a contract that we have between you and me in the syllabus. We see that my name Rafael and Data work in the Department of Engineering Management and there is my email. You can contact me if you have any problem. The textbook that we're going to use is the project management, the Managerial Process Fifth Edition by Gray and Larson. And this is a great book. It aligns very well with the way that I teach the course. Actually, I thought that somehow I had to be an author of that book because of how well it aligns with my class. So but that's a joke, of course. But I hope that you enjoy the book as much as I do. And there are other materials and articles that I'm going to be providing that are going to be available in the package that will support the learning modules. And in other words, what I'm saying is that there are readings that you are going to get from the books, but also there are additional readings that I'm providing to you.

Of course, overview as we go through. We went through the objectives. This is about exploring the selection, design, execution, control, evaluation and termination of projects to meet project objectives and customer expectations within performance constraints and resources constraints in a technical environment. It covers the basic tools and techniques of project management. Nevertheless, they are going to be some very advanced cutting edge. Project management tools that I am going to be covering towards the end of the course so that you get a glimpse of what project management also can be. And so the goal of this course is to facilitate the knowledge that will aid an engineer to successfully manage projects. If you are not an engineer, it will help you anyways. But we again the this course is housed in the engineering management department within the College of Engineering. So we stress that the engineering point of view in all our courses. Nevertheless, managers or non-technical people can go through this course and you may have some you may have to look into some concepts, basic concepts, but in general you'll be able to satisfy all the expectations of this course. We went through the course objectives already, so I'm not going to cover them. The course approach. This is a taught using a synchronous media and therefore it is expected that you comply to those rules set up by the Distance Learning Department on how to communicate with structures.

Class preparation. It is important that you take into. Account that for every class you are supposed to have. Some readings that that before that will enable you to understand better what we're going to be talking in the learning module. In other words, it is important that you go through the readings before you actually watch the class so that you have the background needed to understand the discussion discussions and the points that we're going to be talking in this in each learning module. Assignment. There's going to be a course project, and that course project has two deliverables. Deliverable number one is the project proposal in which you are going to let us know what is what you're going to do. And it is very short and however, it's very important because it will put you to think about what is what you want to do. And there is a second deliverable, which is the final project, and that is actually the big portion of the course project. And it is about how you are going to be planning for a project. So it is the project is about developing, developing a project plan. So I know that it sounds a little bit confusing, but just keep it in perspective. The Course project is a project plan, okay, And I'm going to provide you with more details within the.

Uh, of course back. So look in there and there's going to be a very more detailed explanation of what it is. But in general, what we are looking for you to do is to plan for a project, and that planning should have some task things that you need to do to accomplish the project objectives. And those things are supposed to be 20 plus minus three tasks or activities that you need to do to accomplish those objectives. And in the Journal there is an important portion which is the Project Journal. And again, I will provide you with more details of the project journal in the document. But the Journal is supposed to chronicle the activities that took place. So in your during the life cycle of your project because we are only talking about the planning of a project you are supposed to chronicle the. Events that took place during the planning of that project. And again, we will talk more about the Project Journal in an going to be a document that outlines very clearly what it is the project going on. Then we have. Voices that I call them differently. It is the organizational and self-replication tasks. These quizzes are. Usually very short. This quiz is. Uh, will run between probably 10 to 30 minutes to solve them. And you don't need to actually do much work. However, it is expected that you are going to spend a few time, probably 80% of the time will be dedicated to thinking on how to resolve the problem.

So again, it's a very short and on problem, but that will demand a good amount of thinking to actually be able to resolve it. And that's the case for every OSA that we're going to have. Then there is the plan do study Act, which is reflection is a journal pretty much that you're going to cover after completing each class. And you need and you are expected to answer two questions. Verse one. What was the most important thing you learned from this lesson, and how can you use the topic to better understand your work area? If you don't work, you can think about your career as being your work area. Format. This is important to fulfill the needs of the university and the needs of the instructor so that we have a clear way of identifying who wrote the document and also to make notes on your evaluation. The other important thing that I want to talk about with respect to the format of the document, the course project, is that it is very likely that you will need to have a. A page orientation in your document. That is a landscape. And however, we're talking about a document that usually documents are in a in. In a portrait orientation. So the important thing to mention at this point is that. Microsoft Word has the ability to.

Input or to have within a portrait oriented document, a landscape oriented page. So what I have here on the screen is a procedure that you can use to actually input one landscape oriented page that may hold, let's say, a Gantt chart that is really wider and and then use it within your document and then continue with the portrait orientation. So that is a very nice feature to use and will make your document to look very professional. The other thing is that it is suspected that you have a table of content and Microsoft Word also has an automatic feature that will help you to have a table of content, table of figures already there and it's automatic. And as and when you begin to add more and more pages, the number of pages in your table of content update automatically. If not, you just need to refresh, but it will come on very nicely. So we are going to provide you with the document, a template that has been preset. However, I believe that there shouldn't be any student going out of a program without knowing actually how to put together a document with table of Contents and with all these features, then that that will make your document look more professional and makes you look way good in your with your supervisors and with anyone that has been involved with you. Academic integrity, the honor system or the honor system is in place and pretty much what we want you to enjoy the learning process, but not to cheat because that's again against the rules and it's not expected in terms of the evaluation.

Here's how we have set the weight of each of these assignments. They all sets are 30% and the course project is 60% and the Pdsa's are 10% grade conversion, 100 to 95 is a 93 to 90 is a -89 to 87 is B plus 86. 33 is B 82 to 80 is B -79 to 77 is C plus 76 to 73 is C, 72 to 70 is C minus and 69 or below is F. Remember that you are expected at a graduate level to maintain a GPA over B, So I think that you are only allowed one C during your program, but check with your administrator to understand what the expectations from the students. Here's the schedule. Organization of the course that we're going to follow. What is important for you to understand here is that we have an assignment column that you need to work on. After you have completed the learning module, the first column. So the second column talks about the description of the learning module. And the third column from left to right is the assigning readings for the class. So this is what you need to complete before you actually watch the class. And then after the class is over, then you need to complete the assignment, which is the last column to the right.

And.

You'll see that that we have. 26 learning modules and that will go through the most important aspects of project management. With this, I'm completing the discussion of the learning module and I'll go back to the presentation. Another important thing to mention and to set the rules and expectations from you on this course is to understand how do we get in trouble. So here are the three most important things to remember. You come to the instructor after the fact. You did something not expected or you didn't do something expected. So if you have any problem, please let the instructor or the administrator know as soon as possible so that we can actually work with you and meet your expectations as we meet also the instructor and the school expectations. And if you want to do something that is not expected, again, just let us know and then we will find out how we can actually accommodate your needs. Let's start now covering some material. If there is one slide that I would like you to remember throughout this course and throughout all the learning modules is this one. This is the big picture. And as we actually see this course fitting into what actually happens every day on the field. So what we have on the left is a current ETM or engineering and technology management estate. So we are in that state and we would like to move that state to the other extreme, which in which we have the yellow star future of the engineering technology management state.

So we have a vision or we have goals that we need to accomplish for moving that current state to the future state or where we are and where we want to be. And this can be as simple as a task that we need to do today, and that needs to be done by the end of the day. Or it can be as complex as today being in, let's say, in 2010 and the future state is in 2020. So it can be at the very tactical level, operational level or strategic level. However, we go through this process pretty much every day in every single thing that we do. So the first thing that we do is that we go through a process of gathering intelligence, gathering knowledge about that current state so that we can actually begin to identify what is what we need to do, how we need to do it, and to what extent, so that we feed that intelligence into a decision making process in which we evaluate alternatives. What about if I do it this way? What about if I do it the other way in which we actually frame the problem So what it is that we need to do and and what it is that we need to do, what are the resources that I have available and what is the most important criteria to make the decision? So all that goes, goes, goes on sometimes in a matter of seconds.

Sometimes it's a matter of days when it's a very complex decision. And at the same time, what's going on is a risk management effort in dealing with these options and trying to understand if what will happen If we take option A, option B, option C, we are all the time juggling the risk of each of these decisions. Sometimes we even juggling the the risk of not going through a robust decision making process at all. In other words, we just go straight from gathering knowledge to making decisions to continue to actions without actually using any type of of robust decision making process. Finally, of course, the most important thing is that we take action so that we can actually move the current state to the future state. What is important to mention is that at this risk management effort is going to inform the knowledge about the current past or future situations. So it is very much a source of knowledge to the next time that we will do a similar or a task. And so we can see that the first box as a knowledge repository that we are going to be feeding based on the outputs of the risk management effort and based on the actually task that we took on and how well we actually closed that performance gap to move us from the current state to the future state.

The other thing that is important to mention is the box below, which is reflection. And we go through a reflection process after everything is done. So how well would we make the decisions, how well we took the actions, what did we learn through taking those actions and how and what did we learn through the whole process of gathering intelligence and making a decision and taking action? So 604 fits into this decision making and environment, this big picture, by providing you with the knowledge that you need every time that you manage a project, you are going to have other courses that are required courses in the program that will deal with the different set of knowledge and skills. For example, there are courses that may deal more into the decision making process and to the risk management process, and that will help you to also not only gather knowledge on the situation, but also help you to make decisions and manage risk. So my vision today is that I'm getting this student that might be an engineer, a manager, or with a different background.

And through 604, my vision is to make you become a better manager. Somehow, through this course, I would like to inducing you some thoughts, some material, some knowledge that is going to help you to understand better. And if we go back. Understand better your current situation in a project so that you make better decisions. Assess better risk. Understand what's going on so that you can use it in the future and take better actions all the time. So all you see is all interrelated, double headed arrows that help us go and move from the current state to a future state. Okay with this? I complete this first learning module. A lot of excitement here and hope that you feel excited as well to go through the remaining learning modules. And so highlights of this learning module. Expectations were set and the requirements and expectations to complete the course were also covered. And as I said, look into the syllabus more in detail and really carefully and also read what is expected from the course project that is also provided in your course pack. Another important thing to mention is that every learning module will close with a highlight slide or a couple of highlight slides. And so I'll see you in learning module number two. And thank you very much.",3676,"[ 0.00075729 -0.00997529 -0.00662359 ... -0.01146493  0.00194518

Introduction to Project Management,2.0,PM,"Title: Introduction to Project Management; Description: Learning Module number two is an introduction to Project Management. It covers the background and basics of project management, as well as fundamental concepts. The module aims to provide a foundation for the rest of the course. The historical development of project management started in the 1950s and 1960s as a way to manage large projects. Project management is not just a set of tools, but a planning, organizing, and controlling of resources to achieve project objectives. It is important for managers, those looking for a formal approach to work, individuals new to project management, and anyone looking to improve their career. The project management body of knowledge is held by the Project Management Institute and is a global reference for project managers.; Transcript: Hello and welcome to Learning Module number two. Introduction to Project Management. And we're going to go through a very important concepts of that builds the foundation of project management, and I will build the foundation of this course. So topics that we're going to cover in this module include the background basics of project management and fundamental concepts of project management. All this will help us to begin a foundation for the whole course that we're going to be going through. You have the objectives of this learning module. First of all, appreciate the background of an historical development of the project management discipline. Identify the important characteristics of the project and project management and make sure that we understand the difference between the content of projects and the context of projects. And finally, this course, the life cycle issues, and from a system perspective in the project management. So let's go and talk about a little bit on the background of project management. Project management started in the early 50s and 60s as a way to actually manage very large projects in the Department of Defense in the United States and NASA. The major issue that they were having was that the. There were big programs, major programs, and these programs had more than one person in working in the program. So when the customers wanted to know what was going on, what was the status of critical task and what has been accomplished? There was nobody that I was actually able to answer the call. And and excuse me the question. So what what ended up happening is that there was a major disconnect between the customers and major project stakeholders and the actual project.

So when customers came into the project asking for what was going on, the people working in the project began to pass the ball. Well, that's not my problem is person X problem. And then they went to person X and now it's the other person's problem. So there was not really someone accountable or responsible for the project. So all that generated that. Someone really had to be empowered and accountable for anything that goes in the project and that is the project manager. And that's how actually the project management discipline started. And and after that, major things have happened. So let's talk now about who should care about project management. Any manager responsible for working on the resources and performance constraints? This sounds as a very broad statement, but in reality this is what is going on in every manager and in every project manager. We always work with a certain amount of resources that might be money, might be people, might be facilities, and all that will influence the performance of the project. So we always manage within to those two to a couple of constraints. The constraint of the performance set for the project and the constraints of the resources available. So from the project management point of view, we are going to be talking a lot about these two constraints. You will listen to me mention them throughout the course because these two are really define what is what we're going to do and and how we can actually be able to do it because of the limited availability of resources.

The second one is those interested in a formal approach to design an account and control work. So anyone that would like to have a work design that helps them to have a really good understanding of how all the pieces are going to fit, can use project management, then those required to manage projects and never heard or have any type of project management training or education before. I have usually a lot of students every semester that comes to class because they were given a project management position, but they haven't gotten any type of training. So this happens a lot. And finally, if anyone is in jeopardy in their career and they would like to put things back on track, here is how you can use project management in your career. You can also use it in your personal life in many different aspects. So let's talk about a little bit about the discipline of project management. There is a an institute that actually. Governed or put together the body of knowledge of knowledge management. This institute is called the Project Management Institute or the PMI, and it has a. Big audience. And a membership right now is approaching the the 300,000 actually is 280 something. So it has been growing really fast in the last years. And they hold the project management body of knowledge, which is also called the PMBoK. And and that is usually a reference for all project managers around the world.

This is this is one of those societies that is not only holding in the US, but is actually a global society. You can find chapters of the PMI pretty much in every continent and almost in every country. With respect to the body of knowledge, even though the PMI has its own body of knowledge and is very. Fixed or static. They make revisions once in a while. The real body of knowledge from the academic point of view, it is in the journals, academic journals and some practitioners journals as well as in magazines. But to those interested in expanding the understanding of project management, you can actually look at these resources and we have those resources available at the university. So with your registration, you will be able, if you have a chance to log in through a Internet in the website and get into the library website and then access some of these project management journals. The first one is the PM Journal, the project management Journal, and that is linked to the Project Management Institute. They hold conferences every years and they are issues, if I'm not mistaken, between 4 and 5 issues every year. Then there is an international journal of Project management which is more academic oriented. The readings are more dense. It is more into advancing the body of knowledge. The project management journal, the previous one. It is more practitioner oriented and the readings are more towards the manager. It is usually written from project managers to project managers or from academics to project managers.

In the International Journal of Project Management. It is written usually from academics to academics, and that makes the reading to project managers a little bit dense. And then there are new ones like the International Journal of Project, Organization and Management that has been put in the Inderscience publisher last year and is in the first issues. And then there are many professional certifications in project management. There are schools, universities offering them and we offer one and there are at least a. One in pretty much in every state or parish school in the US. And then there are masters of science in project management. Again, there are schools that hold them. And if you go and look into the journals, you'll see that the project management body of knowledge never stopped growing. It is a continuous flow of literature going into these journals because of many reasons why. One is because the project project management changes depending on the environment that depending on what the project is. And as new technologies comes in and new products and services are needed to put out, then project management had to be at a. Adapted to this new environment. So you will see different type of of topics in these journals and flowing pretty much in every issue. So let's talk now about the basics of project management so that we begin to build the foundation for what's coming next. First question is what is a project? And I just want you to for a few seconds think about that.

What is a project? What is a project for you? Have you ever worked in one? How can you define that? So. After you have got that picture in your mind. Let's move now into what academics have said. First, it is a threat to establish authority and a status quo and. The other one is a multicolored pretty picture drawing tool. Such a source of frustration. And finally, it's an unjustified negative of work. In reality. The aid project's characteristics are. There is one ultimate accountable individual, and that is the most important characteristic of projects. The major difference between a project and something else is because you have a project manager and that project manager is empowered and responsible for the performance of the project. The other thing is that is a one time effort. So it happens in a certain period of time and it is just one shot. So if you are going to build, for example, bridges, you may say that the you will have 2 or 3 bridges in the same river, but in reality, every project is just one shot. Every bridge is going to be one single project and it has a start and end date. So we in the beginning know when we are beginning that project start date and when we are supposed to complete that project and the end date and it has an objective and a scope or the amount of work that we are supposed to do and the requirements that we need to fulfill to make the customer and the stakeholders happy.

Then these are unique product or service. Going back to the bridge example in even though we have a same type of bridge over the same river. We can say that every bridge is unique because of the position, because of the place that is going to be because of the people working in that project. So so they generate unique products or unique services and that represents, again, the content and context of the project. And number six, address problems or needs. Usually when we put projects together is because there is something that had to be done in an organization and that can be again, addressing a need, addressing a threat, a weakness or capitalizing an opportunity. And we will talk more about that in the next learning module. And what actually generates Project number seven is a temporary organization. I love this characteristic because it's really important for students to understand. The reason why I believe is so important is because early in my career, I was a. Encouraged to apply to a fellowship to cover part of my graduate studies. And the fellowship was actually. Issued by Walt Disney World. Industrial Engineering Department. And the whole goal of of this fellowship was to. Bringing graduate students into the organization and. Try to understand their ability to manage projects in complex environments. The only way that you can do that is if you give the applicant or the or the prodigy the opportunity to to demonstrate his or her capabilities. So when organizations put projects in this way, what they are looking is.

To see if.

This person is going to have the qualities of the people that they would like to in the future to join large projects as project managers or grow in the organization in the in the hierarchy of the organization. So. Projects provide that setting very well. These are setting that is very, very complex. It's a setting that has start dates, end dates and goals that needs to be achieved. You have communication with all your stakeholders, so you pretty much put all your soul, brain and energy in a project. So it really demonstrate your abilities to become a manager in a large organization. So. Projects being temporary organizations. Help the organization to understand the ability of someone to become part of, not of the organization. The project manager of a project is pretty much the CEO of an organization, so you need to look yourself from that point of view. When you become project manager, you are the CEO of a small temporary organization. Then finally, of course, the most important for some organizations and actually some people is that it has a budget. We need to pay contractors, we need to pay materials, we need to pay services, we need to pay overhead, indirect costs, direct costs. We need to pay many things.

So we need to have a budget to know how much that project is going to cost. And we're going to talk about that during the. Of course. So what is project management to those that have been involved in the project management domain? You will have your own definition, most likely. After we complete this course or you already have one. I'm bringing some that I like a lot and that I believe brings a to perspective. Many of the important aspects of project management. First one. Project management is the planning, scheduling and controlling of project activities to achieve project objectives. That is very technical because focus on the on the activities. The second one, Project management is the planning, organizing, directing and controlling of company resources. As you can see, we're talking now about resources constraints for a relative short term. Objective that has been established to complete the specific goals and objectives. So you have pretty much in this definition, both the balance between the performance constraints and the resources constraints. Finally, we have Keating's definition, which I like a lot. This is the one that I like the most. It's a systemic process of design, execution and transformation of a project to meet the specified objectives and customer expectations within allocated resources and performance constraints.

So pretty much what he's talking is that balance between performance and resources constraints, but also is that process of transforming your plan and your and controlling the execution of that plan so that you can actually achieve those goals. So most likely you will develop your own through this course if you haven't already developed one. I just want to be sure that we understand what project management is not. It is not a set of tools and techniques, although this is really close to what some people have said. Project management gives you a set of tools that you can use in different domains. However, it's way more than tools. It also involves the human side. And when you bring the two together, we talk about the social technical systems. So. Uh, the second one is not a software. There are many software outside that help you to do project management, but the software is not project management. There was a time in which I went to a very large organization that manages three large projects, and I went to visit a friend. And when I got into his cube, he had this he has his walls all.

He has in.

His wall a lot of Gantt charts of the projects that he was working on. So I went through it and these were very nice pictures. I mean, many colors, lines everywhere. And I asked him, Where are you today in these charts? And the answer was, well, these charts were printed the first day of the project, and that was about three, four months ago. And next week we had to change everything. So they are pretty much obsolete. I just put it there because they look nice. So it is not a software and it is not a Gantt chart or birth chart. It is not solution for work. So you will need to again employ many other qualities or capabilities to make things happen. It is not a management approach to cover poor managerial skills and it is not a method that can ensure success. It's not a silver bullet. So we need to make sure that we devote a humongous amount of effort to try to understand what's going on at any time and then plan accordingly, be as flexible as possible. There is always this question about what is a program manager and programs, what is project management or projects? So here is a in a nutshell, what's the difference between the two? When we talk about program, there is no limited amount of time or if there is a limited amount of time, it's really large and we're talking probably about many years or decades. And in terms of funding is always funding for programs. And for example, in the company that I used to work for, we had a continuous improvement program which was implemented in the company and it has a stream of resources going in, not only money.

And and we talk about being in this program as a way of doing business. So as long as the business exists, it was going to be a program going on. And on the other hand, projects are very unique and and they happen only once. And you have a specific performance constraints and specific resources constraints. And for example, in this factory that I used to work for, we had this continuous improvement program that actually housed many different projects. And one of those projects was the modernization of a production line of a can manufacturing production line. And it happened only once. And then of course, that line is there, working forever and for many years. Okay. Let's continue to talk about some other projects, fundamentals that we need to cover in this foundational learning module. The first thing is that we have this inter relationship across many critical success factors of projects. And the big dilemma is how to actually juggle all these factors without affecting performance. In other words, what I'm saying is that performance is a function of many critical success factors, and those critical success factors are all interrelated in ways that we may be able to perceive or predict, or sometimes we are just not able to see the connections among all of them. What I'm showing on the screen right now is. Few of the many critical factors that you can find in projects cost, time, scope, quality and satisfaction. If we change our cost by reducing cost to try to please the customer immediately, we are going to change the scope of the project because we may not be able to cover what we actually planned for and and that might be completely correlated.

Also with time, we won't have as enough time as we hadn't before and and therefore the customer might might not be pleased. So in other words, it generates a change of effects across all the other critical success factors with respect to quality, which is something that is commonly used in organizations when they want to put a product outside as quickly as possible, they always sacrifice quality. Let's say, well, let's cut quality or let's let's stop the testing of the product right now and let's push the product out. And we know that there are several organizations using this type of approaches, for example, in software organizations and but anyway, if we change quality with the objective of speed up time and reduce cost, we may be hurting the customer satisfaction. So as you see, there is all interrelationships among all, at least these five critical success factors that I have on the screen now. The other thing that we need to understand with respect to project management is that we go through a cycle of steps that happen pretty much at any time, at any level when we perform technical activities within the project or when we perform management activities within the project. And those management activities can be more one, some technical and some other ones more soft or social or strategic. But we always go through this plan, do study Act cycle that was adapted by Kuttner from a early material, seminal material put by Juran in the early 80s. So it all starts with a plan.

And now we.

Somehow have very robust plans or we have very informal plans that we set together so that we can actually plan or identify the activities that are needed to achieve certain project objectives. The next thing that we do is we actually implement or execute the plan, trying to be always within our performance constraints and resources constraints. And in other words, not not exceeding the resources that that we that we plan for and not making sure that we also meet the customer expectations. And then we study. We look back into how well we actually perform our due phase. So how well we met the customer expectation, how well we met at the performance requirements and what did we learn during the project? Is there any lessons learned, hard lessons learned, good lessons learned, or what is also called best practice, How well we met our objectives and how well everybody actually works in with us at trying to achieve the customer expectation. So, so far we have planned to do the activities, we have executed the activities, we have achieved certain performance, and we also have generated some type of learning. And that will help us to go to the next phase, which is a really critical one, which is using what we have learned so that we next time that we perform similar activity, we improve our performance. That's what we call continuous improvement. And that's the heart of actually this study Plan-do-study-act PDSA model, which is continuous improvement going on all the time at any level within groups, within individual, at the technical level and the strategic level.

Hmm.

So let's talk now about the project management content, which is what really makes or build a project. It includes tools, techniques, knowledge, methods that help us to achieve the project objectives. Everything that will help us as project managers to actually work within performance constraints so that we can actually achieve our goals or meet our performance constraints. The content of a of a project contains different areas. So the PMBoK, the project management body of knowledge from the Project Management Institute, outlines those areas very well. I have on the screen some of the most critical areas of a project, and that includes cost management. Of course, everything related to setting budgets and controlling expenditures and quality management, controlling the attributes of the deliverables that we are submitting to the customer. Human Resource management. How do we manage people? Risk management, how we make sure that we understand the risk or scenarios that can jeopardize the. Performance of our project. When we talk, performance may be performance and also resources or capabilities. Next one, communication management how we make sure that we have. A communication system that will enable the project stakeholders to communicate with the team and with the project manager. Scope Management. How do we make sure that we. Produce or we generate or we work on the. Work that we agree to work on since the first day. In other words, when we set up objectives and set up performance constraints, we were making sure we are creating boundaries of what it is that we are going to do and what it is that we are not going to do.

So scope management is making sure that we work, that we work only on those things that we were supposed to work. Project integration management, how we make sure that we integrate different perspectives, different stakeholders and different technical domains and deliverables into existing systems. So in other words, it goes from the human side of integrating people and also goes from the technical side of integrating work and integrating deliverables into existing systems. When we actually go and deliver our products into the customer. And time management. So what's the schedule that we have? How we manage the schedule? How. How do we set times? And finally, contract and procurement management. How do we make sure that we understand our contractors and we measure the performance and evaluate them? So that next time we understand which one, which ones are the. Ones that we would like to work on, work with, and which one are the ones that we don't want to work with. There are other critical areas that we have proposed personally have been working in this knowledge management in projects area and crisis management in projects areas and knowledge management deals more into the learning that of during projects and making sure that your next projects will have that knowledge available so that they can actually don't go through your same mistakes or capitalize on your best practices. It also involves providing intelligence to people, I mean important information and knowledge that they need so that they can accomplish their task.

Crisis management deals with firefighting. How we in projects sometimes gets into a firefighting mode because of the issue of trying to balance performance constraints with resources constraints and in a very complex environment. With respect to project management context, this is all. The circumstances or the environment that surrounds a project that impacts those critical constraints that we have of performance and capabilities constraints. And it has a direct impact on your, let's say, cost or money or the money side of the project and the people side of the project and the time side of the project. And it is important to understand these critical aspects of the context because they can act as enablers, but also as barriers of projects. So I have on, on on the screen many of the most important ones. That doesn't mean that there might be some other ones that I'm not including here, but we can talk about support and infrastructure offices, computers, transportation that we have available to the project. The organizational structure or design. How the organization actually is has groups of people, folks focus on different areas and how those groups are linked so that they can achieve certain strategic intent in the organization. I know project team design, how we make sure that we put the the project team to work together towards a goal. The style of the manager, the the type of leadership style that he or she actually exerts, the type of systems available that might be management management system, human resource management systems and organizational processes that we use.

For example, when we go to accounting to help pay a certain contractor or when we actually funnel money from the customer or the project sponsor into the project so that we can actually make some expenditures. The culture of the organization are very critical one, and also the national culture just down few bullets. Those are critical aspects of the context of project because they affect people and people affects the technical performance of the project and the consequence will affect the performance and the satisfaction of the customer, the project dynamics, how everything is interrelated. One aspect affects another one and affects another one. And then we talk about having a project management system. And the philosophy and strategy of the organization. What is really the goal and how we plan to meet the goal? And that also somehow correlated with the culture, the market in which the organization is working on. So what are the what's the industry in which the organization performs or the sector in which the organization performs? What are the standards of that sector? What is expected of a project that is actually managed within that sector? And finally, technology. Technology is available in some places, it's not available in some others, and technology can really affect how we actually do projects. A good example is what about if we need to perform a project in the middle of nowhere in which we don't have access to cell phone, to satellites, communication to anything? Our communication will be impacted because of the lack of technology, and as a consequence, our team dynamics might be affected and the performance of the project as a consequence be also affected.

It will be completely different if we do a project within a. Very well developed large city, which we pretty much have access to any type of technology. So again, these are just a few of the most important aspects of the context because they affect the capabilities of the project and as a consequence, they may affect the performance of the project. There might be some other ones not included here. Therefore and this is a very important slide, a unique organizational context which generates a unique project management content, even though we have some technical aspects of the project or some requirements of the project that we need to meet. The organizational context will affect how those requirements are going to be met. So generating. They are that every project is going to be pretty much unique and pretty much a. Something that we cannot say that is going to happen again in exactly the same way. Another very important concept that we need to talk about today is the concept of time and how projects goes through a life cycle when they start and when they die. So we have start date and an end date. It's a one shot effort. So we talk about having a project life cycle.

And.

Usually have at least four phases. Different organizations use use different phases and different sub phases. I have been in organizations that they use just these four, but I have worked with organizations that they have 14 different phases which are pretty much you can actually fit any of those 14 phases within these major phases that we have on the screen now. So the first part of first phase, it is usually called the conceptualization or the initiation phase in which the requirements of the projects are set. And by the customer and the organization evaluates if this is something that they would like to do or not. Sometimes it's vice versa. Sometimes it's the organization that defines we would like to do this project and let's try to see if it is a viable project for the organization or not. So you might have two perspectives one of a customer asking the organization to do a project or the other one is an internal project within the organization. But in any way we define the requirements there and we evaluate if that project has a good business case, if it is important or not to the organization, you assign a project manager and maybe you also assign a team at that stage. Then we move on into the planning in which we actually try to set up the actions that needs to happen so that we can actually meet the objectives or requirements set by the customer.

We make sure that we align resources with tasks or activities so that we have a clear understanding of the limitations from the point of view of resources and so that we can actually function in that. Environment that has a. Uh, performance constraints. Next is the execution in which we implement that plan. We bring people together. We bring the services and our contractors, and we go through each of the tasks that we plan so that we can actually achieve the objectives. We also talk about in this phase as being execution and control. Because guess what? One thing is what we plan for and another thing is what is actually going to happen. And so we need to make sure that we control the. Capabilities that we have so that in terms of, let's say, time, money, people, so that we actually not underuse or overuse them. And we also need to monitor how well we are meeting the customer expectations in terms of satisfaction, human satisfaction and in terms of technical satisfaction, which we also call attributes. Finally, we talk about closure in which we hand the products or the services to the customer and there is a formal agreement and there is a formal release of the resources that the project use during the project life cycle.

And there is a close closure of all the. The account open and and the close the project goes again to a final date. We usually. At this point have what is called a project management end of the project review or meeting. Sometimes it's a small celebration, and the opposite of that celebration is what we call a kickoff meeting that happens in when for the first time the project is actually the team is getting together. So usually it happens in the concept or the initiation phase and but in some organizations, sometimes they do different kickoff meetings, sometimes they do one in the concept or the initiation phase, and they do another one at the execution phase. As soon as they are starting implementing the plan just to bring people together. Finally, I just want to share this slide that has different factors all somehow interrelated and. What I want to talk about here is, is somehow. Express the complexities of the project environment. I'm showing a few factors on the screen, but we will see very soon how all those factors are interrelated. The culture may impact the design of the project or the or the technical design of the product impacts. The human side impacts how we plan the scheduling impacts control impacts the human impacts techniques.

So everything very much is interrelated. Actually, I'll even say a good rule of thumb is just assume that everything is interrelated, that as soon as you make any change in any part of the project, there's going to be something else change somewhere else, somewhere else. And you may or may not know what is that other thing that is going to be changed. So and. With this, I complete module number two, and there are several highlights that I will go through very quickly. First one is that the project management body of knowledge has grown exponentially. Project Manager is about effective and efficient use of resources to accomplish project under performance constraints. A project is a temporary organization that produces a unique product or service. Project managers must constantly balance performance and resources constraints. Every project has a life cycle which begins with the conceptual phase or initiation phase and ends in the project. Closure has a start and end date. Project context includes the internal tools, techniques and knowledge needed for an efficient achievement of project objectives and project context includes the internal and external circumstances, patterns and characteristics that affect the project performance and capabilities. Every project has a unique project management system. Okay. So I hope that you have enjoyed this learning module number two, and I'll see you in learning module number three.",6730,"[-0.0072161  -0.01360677 -0.00444638 ... -0.00778359 -0.00432386

Introduction to Project Selection,3.0,PM,"Title: Introduction to Project Selection; Description: In Learning Module 3, the topics covered are project initiation, project selection, and project selection models. The objectives of this module are to understand the importance of project initiation and selection, identify important factors to consider in project selection, and discuss project selection models. Initiating a project is often based on internal and external factors, such as a business need or customer demand. A SWOT analysis can help identify these factors by examining the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the organization. Project selection involves evaluating different candidates and making a decision based on criteria such as alignment with the organization's strategic plan and value proposition. Two major decision-making criteria are the extent to which the project supports the strategic plan and the value it creates for the organization and the customer. It is important to be explicit about selection criteria, identify the necessary capabilities for decision-making, consider assumptions made during the process, and build a project selection team. The value proposition of a project includes the cost, direct benefits, and indirect benefits, and it is important to analyze the value proposition from the perspectives of both the customer and the project organization. Different project selection models exist, and selecting the most suitable one depends on factors such as usefulness, capability, flexibility, and usability. Other considerations in project selection include organizational priorities, resource utilization, risk, and stakeholder involvement. It is important to understand that models only support the decision-making process and that they are a partial representation of the real world. The ultimate decision is whether to fund the project or not.; Transcript: Okay. Hello. Welcome to Learning module number three. What we're going to cover in this learning module is the introduction to project selection and how we actually ended up defining what is the project that we're going to work on. And these are very interesting learning module because it brings different concepts into the selection of a project. So topics that we're going to cover, project initiation, project selection and project selection models. Objectives of Learning. Module three. Understand the role and importance of project initiation and selection. Identify important issues that should be considered in project selection. Discuss the characteristics that might be considered in choosing a project selection model and discuss the issue of project selection models. So let's understand what initiates a project. And what I would like you to think about right now is if you are working in any project, in any task right now, think about it for a few seconds. What really initiated that endeavor, that project, that initiative that you are working right now? What is the thing that the organization, you or your supervisor is looking for to get from that initiative, from that task, that project? So who would really understand what initiated the project? So let's look at this very well known tool called SWOt analysis. The SWOt analysis is a very strategic look at the organization or at your current unit in which work unit excuse me, in which we step back and study. What are the strengths of that work unit, the weaknesses of that work unit, the opportunities of that work unit and the threats to that work unit.

That's what we call the SWOt analysis. And now when we look into strengths and weaknesses, we look into the internal costs. And when we look into opportunities and threats, we're talking about external causes. When we talk about internal causes to initiate the project, it is usually because there is a business need. So within the organization, it's an internal project. There is a need to actually address a weakness within the organization, and that weakness might be an issue in the way that we are performing certain tasks and we are having some problems with the customer. Or maybe because there is a technical problem that needs to be fixed within any of the systems within the organization. Even though I didn't include here the strengths. As you see as internal causes, some organizations sometimes decide to actually fund the project to make sure that they strengthens their strengths and and they become more, let's say, solid into the environment that they function in. Now moving to external causes, which as you see, there are many. It might be because the customer asked the organization to generate certain deliverables or certain services, as you see. I point this as an opportunity and also as a threat. Why? Well, because if the customer comes to you and say, Will you please do me this project? And your response is, No, I cannot do it.

They will immediately go to guess who your competition. So if they go to your competition, that's a threat. You are opening a line of business with your competitor. Therefore they might be getting funding that is later on or that later on will trickle down to be important to your organization. So it can be seen as an opportunity and as a threat if we are not actually being able to please that customer request. A market change is another one. So out of the sudden there is this new way of doing business or new products or new services. Put it out or new expectations from the customer that if we are able to very easily meet them, there might be an opportunity. But if we are not, if we are not in a in a in a capacity to meet those new needs of the market, then we can see that as a threat. Similarly with the technology advance, if we are going to be able to have the latest technologies implemented within the organization or within certain areas or not, that might be if we are able to implement them, that's an opportunity. But if not, it's going to be a threat because now we are falling behind on what actually is the next technologies in our field and therefore we are opening the opportunity to other competitors to actually shut us down or gain some of our business advantage. A legal requirement. When we talk about green technologies, we see that there are a lot of requirements right now to protect the environment.

So if there is a new law or new regulation and we are not able to meet them, that that might be a threat to the organization and therefore to the performance and survivability, sustainability to the organization. But if we are able to quickly meet the the regulation, that might be an opportunity because now we can actually. Praise the organization as one as being green or as one as a meeting, or exceeding certain codes or standards, which again may attract new customers and enhance the image of the organization. And finally, there might be a social need, something coming out of the environment from the community that would be a good opportunity to actually teach and project the organization as being a customer driven and and to fulfill some needs in the society. So this SWOt analysis strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats and threats. Looks into internal and external aspects of the organization and and that may open the opportunity to actually put together projects to fulfill some of the needs or some of the opportunities or eliminate some of the threats of the organization. So let's talk about project selection. Now that the there is a need. So we are in the initiation stage of the project. There is a need. We need to fulfill the need. So let's see how we can actually fulfill the needs. So in other words, let's talk for example, there is a need to.

Eliminate certain waste in the organization, and that is an internal weakness. And so the next thing that we do is, okay, so now how are we going to do it? So most likely we will have more than one project that is a good candidate or a good alternative to fulfill that weakness or to address that weakness. So project selection is that process in which we have a pool of candidates or alternatives, and we need to go through a decision making process to evaluate which one is the strongest one, which one is the one that we can work with, and then of course implement that one and fund that project to address that weakness. So. Most likely you will be facing at least two major decision making criteria. These two measures, criteria that we're going to cover in this learning module are the. Extent to which the project is going to support the organization's strategic plan. In other words, how the project that you are going to fund is going to meet the. Strategic plan of the organization. So some projects would be very well aligned as some other projects might not be very well aligned and therefore might be needed to shut down later on. The other thing is the value proposition of the project. How much value is the project actually creating to the organization and also to the customer? So we will talk about this first two bullets in the next slide.

However, there might be other decision making criteria that we are going to need to implement. I'm just giving you two very important broad ones and we will see in a few seconds what I meant with these two. Again, going back to the project selection process. In this course. We are going to talk about how we are going to be selecting one project out of a set of projects. However, in reality, you may also have the opportunity to select more than one project if needed. In other words, if you have a need to fulfill, you might fulfill that need by using by actually implementing different projects. In other words, what I'm saying is that let's assume going back to there is an internal weakness in the organization and there are ten different projects that you can implement. However, you have $1 million to invest in these ten projects. So the question is, do you want to fund only one project for $1 million? Or you would like to fund ten projects for $100,000, or you want to fund two projects for half $1 million each? So that's the question that we would like to answer when we are selecting projects. However, in this course, we're going to focus only select on the selection of a single project out of a pool of projects. If you would like to know more about how we can actually. Crunched the numbers in in in a in in a decision making process to try to maximize the use of our money and maximize the impact that the project's going to have on the organization.

I recommend you to look into operations research and there are very nice tools into maximization minimization and what's called linear programming and really good. So in the end, when we have. Uh. Implemented our decision making process. We will see that that we have two different approaches that we can go through. In other words, what I'm saying is that we may use numeric selection models that are usually more objective, but in which we need to make a lot of estimation too. But also we can go through non-numeric models that are very subjective and and rely more on the expert judgment. And they have some pros and cons too. Like, for example, these are sometimes fast and quick decisions that we can make and depending on the environment. Four important rules for selecting projects. The first one is that we need to be as explicit as possible with our selection criteria. So what do we mean that it is going to be a value proposition? How do we measure that value proposition? What do we mean that we need to that the project needs to impact the bottom line? So what is that number that we are looking in terms of profits that we are going to find? So that's pretty much what I'm saying here. So it's not to be profitable.

It is that we are expecting to get a 10% of internal rate of return of or $5 million of net present value at the end of year five. Something like that is pretty much what I'm saying. So we need to be as explicit as possible in that selection criteria. The second one is that we need to identify the capabilities needed to choose the project pretty much is what do we need to go through the decision making process. So do we need to bring people with the special expertise in how to operate a specialized software selection? Project selection software or do we need, again, a special software that we need to buy? Do we need to collect certain type of of data? And that is going to feed that decision making process. So we need to identify where are those capabilities that we need. Or that will enable us to go through that project selection process or that decision making process. The next thing is that we need to study and discuss all the assumptions that we are going to make in that decision making process. As one professor taught me during grad school many years ago, and a good friend of mine right now said, he said that it is it is good. It is. It is okay. It is expected that you actually make assumptions every time that you make decisions. What it is not okay is to make explicit those assumptions in your document.

In other words, what I'm saying is that you today made an assumption that you were going to make certain amount of money in your project. And today the economy, let's say, is somehow stable. Too bad. But what about if things turn bad from this point on and someone comes to you and say, well, you are not meeting the expectations that were set for the project. So you will need to point them out to that portion of your document in which you actually make explicit your assumptions that say, Yeah, but I was actually assuming at that point of time that the economy was going to remain stable, that the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar was going to remain at within these parameters. And then you actually laid down all the assumptions that you make so that they understand that any decision that was made was based on this assumption, conditions that make it true when those conditions change. Of course, most likely there's going to be an impact upon the decisions that you make. And so in other words, it is okay, it is expected to make assumptions, but make sure that you bolatice those assumptions in your report and make sure that that everybody understand and understand them. And and not only from the point of view of what they are, but from the point of view of how they impact the capabilities and may impact the performance of your project. Finally build a project selection team, which is somehow related to number two, but is more into the human side of the project, meaning not only the techniques, not only the tools, the capabilities that you need, but also bringing the expert that is going to help you to have a different perspective on the selection of the project.

They would provide you with critical information, critical data that you will need to do the evaluation. Okay. So now let's talk about this first important criteria. That is the project value proposition and how we can use it to actually select projects. The project value proposition is a concept that comes out of marketing. It is very well known in the marketing and branding fields of organizations, and it has three major elements. The cost of the benefits. The direct benefits and the indirect benefits. When we move and use the model as an analogy in in a project, we're talking about the project value proposition. Or what are the costs of the project? What are the direct project benefits and the indirect project benefits? The cost of the project benefits. Of course, we are talking about from the point of view of the project manager. What are the cost of actually funding this project? We are not talking about profits here. We're just talking about the cost. And from the point of view of the customer, the cost of the project will involve some level of profit at that has been added by the project organisation or the organisation housing the project so that they remain in business.

Sometimes it is a non for profit. There will be zero and the costs are going to be the same. So pretty much as you see here, what I'm providing you is two perspectives. The perspective from the point of view of the customer and perspective from the point of view of the project manager or the organization housing the project. The second one is the direct project benefits. The direct project benefits from the point of view of the customer. It is what it is, that thing that I'm going to get from the project. So if I'm going to fund the development process of a software, what I'm expecting is of course a software that will work in certain platforms and certain computer, and that is my direct benefit. However, there is an indirect benefit in this project as well that comes out of things that we usually don't take into consideration or not that explicitly. And and that's the whole goal of this value proposition model. We'll talk about the indirect benefits we're talking about. What is the company that is providing us with the services and what's the image of that company and how that image will impact our performance. In other words, a company may. Go and hire a certain company, not only because of the ability of the company to give them a direct benefits, but also because the company has certain image that will in turn provide more benefits to the organization.

And I'll give you an example in the next slide. So let's say we need to have an information system and we decide to go with PHP and I don't work for PHP, so it's just an example. And the cost of that software is $1 million. The direct benefits is going to be speed the faster information system in the market. However, the indirect benefit is the prestige that is going to bring to our organization that HP is our solution provider and therefore our customers may think, Oh yeah, if you have HP as your solution provider, that means that your system is reliable, that I will have good customer support. Then again, even though you went to HP to buy a system, what you are also getting is this indirect benefits of having that brand of HP within your system that will help again to provide more support or provide some type of of image to your. Customers and therefore you will benefit additionally from this project and. So when we talk about. Project selection and value proposition. We need to look at how the projects actually provide us with value. And pretty much what I'm saying is that that we are having here a more sophisticated cost benefit analysis that is not only looking at the cost and the benefits, the direct benefits of a project, but also looking at more at a more broader perspective, which involves, again, the indirect benefits.

So we would like to pick the project that actually is going to generate the most value in the project or to select those projects that will generate the most value to the organization or to the customer from the customer perspective. You would like to get the If I'm a customer and I go to an organization, I would like to get the project that will give me more value. In other words, most likely if I'm a customer, I generate what is called a request for proposal RFP, and so that I generate a bidding process in which companies compete and to try to get the funds from me to do the project for me. And of course I will select the project that has the highest value proposition. Okay. Another perspective with respect to the value proposition is the perspective of the organization housing, the project or the project management perspective. And that perspective is the one that we have when we are going to work in different projects. In other words, what I'm saying is that we have the opportunity sometimes to choose in what projects we would like to work on, and that will depend on also on the value proposition. And in other words, what I'm saying is that in the same case that we had before, let's say we are HP, maybe HP will like to work with certain type of customers in which they will have some type of benefits and not only the direct benefits of actually making the money, but also other type of benefits.

For example, they would like to work with new customers overseas to open a new line of business. And sometimes organizations, project organizations will decide to begin to work with the customer even though they won't make money out of it. But they just began to open a new line of business. So we need to look at this value proposition from two different perspectives the perspective of the customer choosing the project organization, and from the point of view of the project organization, choosing what project or what customer they would like to work on. In your course project, you are expected to use this value proposition analysis, meaning that you are expected to analyze the value proposition of your course project from the point of view of the customer and from the point of view of the project organization. Sometimes in few instances you have project organizations actually doing internal projects in in that specific case, the project organization and the customer are going to be the same and therefore you are expected only to do a value proposition for just one single entity, which is the project, organization and customer, which is the same. So again. The two major questions that we ask is why are they going to fund your project? What's your value proposition? How competitive is going to be and why do you want to work on this project? Or why do you want to work with this customer? So now let's talk about this other selection process, which is the fit to the strategic intent or the strategic plan of the organization.

This one is more subjective sometimes, and I'm just trying to represent on the slide a good alignment and a bad alignment. And sometimes we know for sure the extent to which the project is going to contribute to, let's say, the profit for the organization or to enhancing certain areas of the organization or addressing a weakness or a problem within the organization. But sometimes we have projects that are more fussy in which their contributions are not that clear. I'll give you an example. I was working once in an organization doing a design prototype and construction of a of a of a hydraulic bench, and this hydraulic bench had as an objective to actually build hydraulic circuits so that we can actually teach people how to how to operate these circuits and what actually what's going on in there. So this was a project that was happening in a very large organization that has an objective to actually produce or manufacture. Can Well, it was a it was a railway company and the objective of the company was to manufacture plastic cradles to put actually the beer bottles inside. And so it was a big injection molding operation. Injection molding has a very large. Complexities and has a you need to have a very large workshop that will produce or manufacture the injection molds and will give some type of of maintenance to those injection molds.

So what happened was this particular organization had three different workshops, one very sophisticated one with CNC machines, computerized machines, another one that was not that sophisticated, but that handled very large pieces and then a very small one, which they dedicated to me to do this project. So what happened was in the beginning, of course, my project was very well aligned with the strategic goal of the organization because it was going to help to do the training and education of the people. But all of a sudden the organization went through a process in which the production went down, maintenance was not working well and a lot of molds began to be worked in the two major workshops. In the end, they began to take over little by little, my small workshop to a point that my project had to be shut down because of course the production was more important than my hydraulic bench. So that's a good example of how a misalignment to a point of time of a project between the strategic intent of the organization can lead to actually shutting down your project. And also it can be it can lead to getting or not your best resources that are actually going to help you to do a better quality project. So very well aligned project will get a lot of visibility from senior managers and therefore you may be able to gain the best resources, sometimes the best human resources that really good programmers, they're really good engineers and now one that is not that aligned will suffer by lacking the quality resources.

So let's talk now about the project selection models. And when we decide what selection model we will use, we also we always look at different criteria. So if I decide to use a numeric or a non numeric and within the numeric, let's say, HP or ANP that we will talk about in the next learning module or if we would like to go in a more soft human type of decision making model. We need to understand pros and cons of those models. So in other words, how we would like to select them based on their pros and cons. So one thing that we would like to look at is how useful they are and within the usefulness, we would like to look at three things at least, how much this model we will take into consideration realism. In other words, how much the model will be able to account for what is really happening in the world to those that have some knowledge in modeling and simulation. What happened in modeling and simulation is someone or a group of people, knowledge engineers go out and model a system or a phenomenon and then simulate that system of phenomenon. If if we talk about, let's say, flight simulators where pilots are trained, these are models that really portrayal very well the reality.

So we'll see this as a in terms of the realism spectrum and really far end meaning really good in portraying reality. But sometimes we don't have enough knowledge to really put together a model that can actually portrayal really well reality. So we need to make sure that we understand that and the limitations of that because we're going to be making decisions and we would like to make decisions based on real aspect of real characteristics of our environment. The other one is capability. There are some models that can hold, let's say, hundreds of different alternatives and hundreds of different alternatives. While there are models that are not able to hold this amount of. Alternatives. Let's say, for example, if we would like to go with a human or a non numeric decision making process, the number of alternatives that a person can actually manage has been proposed to be around seven. So seven variables can be in our head at any point of time. Making a decision more than that will jeopardize the quality of our decision. So we have certain limitations and in our capability. And flexibility. How well are we going to be able that halfway through the decision making process we make changes that we know will not affect the performance of the decision making at that time? In other words, we might have some models that we can make changes and without going back to zero and starting all over again.

The other thing is how usable are they going to be? Some of these takes a humongous amount of time and you need training and you need specialized software and therefore speed, cost and usability may be all compound to a point that you select, one that gives you a certain amount of of confidence in your decision but is less costly or more fast. And this is actually reality in in the daily task of, of engineering managers and project managers. Sometimes you just go with a way of making decisions that will meet your demands as a human and your demands in the environment. So. When we talk about selecting projects, we need to also consider different issues. For example, what are the priorities of the organization? What is what we need to focus on right now? Because you may have hundreds of different projects. All they are going to make money all with really good value propositions. But however, the organization is having certain priorities, so you may need to rank them in terms of priorities. The other one is in terms of resource utilization, how much money or how much resources you may need versus what is actually what you have to make the decision. The other one is risk. How risky are the decision makers within the organizations or within the organization or not? How risky are those projects and how how much risk is the model able to account for? Then the other one is the stakeholders.

In certain models, you will need a lot of participation from subject matter experts and and you will need to have a way to collect data from them, analyze that data and then input that data in the decision making process. And the larger the number of stakeholders, the more difficult that is going to be. And the other one is really having the participation that you need from them. Or in other words, what is the their focus? In other words, you may have certain stakeholders that are really pro the project. They are with you, they are aligned with what the project is going to produce. But sometimes you have stakeholders that are totally against the project and which may influence the decision making process and the selection process. So those are issues that we need to keep in mind because again, it will influence how we make decisions and how we select the projects that we would like to work on. Another very important slide is the one that we have in front of us, in front of us, and it goes into really the importance of selecting model, selecting projects and how they actually happen. The first one is the first important thing that we need to understand is that the models that we use to make decisions do not make the decision. We are the ones making the decisions. They support the decision.

They provide support to the decision analyst That is going to crunch the numbers and forward the results to the decision maker. Sometimes the decision maker is the same decision analyst But in some other large organizations you have the decision Analyst crunching the numbers, using the models and then forwarding that to the decision maker to make the decision. So models only support the decision making process. They do not make the decision. They let you know which one is the best second, best, third, best they rank, and based on your assumptions and based on your criteria. So the other thing that is important to mention is that models are partial representation of the world. No matter how well we collect data, how well we crunch numbers, how hard we work in doing it, you will never be able to get 100% knowledge. So keep that in mind because that is a big assumption that we have in our models. As one person said one time, a very good academic, Adrian George in our department Management and Systems engineering, sometimes it's better to just go with your intuition and get a solution that is 50% correct, that try to go through a model that will need to generate some interrelationships and some understanding for a complex environment. That next day is going to be totally different. And your model is going to be completely obsolete and therefore you will be making a decision with that 10% valid model. So but anyway, these are food for thought.

And finally, your decision is yes or no, Do I want to fund this project? Yes or no? If we want to complicate the decision a little bit, maybe you can also say to what extent do I want to implement this decision or not so that you can actually maximize resources and fund more than one project. But that's not part of the course. I just want to give you food for thought. So think about what would be your ideal project selection model. We have found in some research that we have done in our department that there is a clear link between the person, the decision maker or the decision analyst and the use of certain decision making models based on the education and based on past experience. People always select the same type of decision making model because of the result that he or she or they have got. Doesn't matter if there are other more sophisticated ones. It seems like they always go with the ones that have worked well in the past and the ones that they know how to use. And the result of a project selection process is yes or no. So with this, I complete this module Number three, the project selection and initiation, and I will see you in learning module number four, in which we begin to understand what are those models that help us to select projects and and then move from Non-numeric to numeric project selection process. So I'll see you in Learning in Learning module number four.",6508,"[-0.00408071 -0.02192523  0.00074325 ... -0.0180245  -0.01114587

Non-numeric Project Selection Models,4.0,PM,"Title: Non-numeric Project Selection Models; Description: In this module, we are discussing non-numeric project selection models and how they can be used to select projects. These models provide alternatives to address weaknesses, threats, and opportunities identified through a SWOT analysis. The four models covered in this module are: power-based, operational-based, competitive-based, and Q-sort. The power-based model involves presenting project proposals to decision makers who have the power to accept or reject them. This model is commonly used in various sectors, such as the military, private, healthcare, and engineering sectors. The operational-based model focuses on funding projects that will help an organization continue functioning or improve certain processes. The competitive-based model focuses on selecting projects that will help the organization remain competitive in its environment, either by capitalizing on opportunities or addressing market threats. Lastly, the Q-sort model involves categorizing projects into high, medium, and low levels based on their potential and evaluating them to determine the best options. These non-numeric models can be subjective and biased, but they can also speed up the decision-making process. In the next module, we will discuss numeric decision-making models.; Transcript: Hello and welcome to module number four Non-numeric Project Selection Models. We are going to talk about what are those models and how we can use them to select projects. Remember from our previous learning module we have covered that we need to come up with alternatives to address a problem or a situation that requires us to put together a project so we perform a SWOt analysis. Strength, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. And we look into how we can actually address a weakness, address a threat, or capitalize on an opportunity in our organizations. So what we're moving now into is, okay, so we have a set of different projects that we would like to fund, but we need to select one of those or more than one. And so the models that we're going to cover in this learning module is about how we select those projects using Non-numeric models. So our topic is Non-numeric, and we're going to discuss the utility and applicability of very basic approaches of Non-numeric project selection. So let's get into these models. These are the four models that we're going to be covering in this learning module. It doesn't mean that there are no more learning modules outside that you can actually use, but these ones really provide a good understanding on the issues that we would like to address by using any of them. So the first one is the power base model, then the operational based competitive base and the Q-sort.

In the end, the power based model is very common in every type of organization. Doesn't matter if it is the military sector, the private sector, or if we're talking about, let's say, the health care unit or in the engineering unit, pretty much everywhere we have humans have used power based models and these type of models. What we have is a set of decision makers that have the power to accept or not a certain proposal to funds a project or a series of projects. So you may have, as I said, a set of decision makers or you may have just a single decision maker. In organizations, we usually talk about a chief knowledge, chief executive officers or Chief VP's senior managers that are the ones that decide if a project is going to be funded or not, or to what extent. It is very common in academia that we send proposals that are going to be to have some type of funds to perform a research project. So, for example, agencies like the National Science Foundation or the National Institute of Health, they have a panel of experts that evaluate and rank the proposals made by professors or institute or research institutions that are seeking to get their projects funded. So a few examples here. Again, you may have a really good example idea of what is what you would like to do, but you always need to go to the decision maker and that decision maker will have the final yes or no on if your project is going to be funded or not.

So again, the power based model is when we propose a project, a project proposal to a panel of experts or a panel of decision makers that understand very well the requirements of the environment, and they decide if it's going to be funded or not, or even to what extent. The next one is the operational base model. In this type of model, what we have is a set of decision makers that have as a criteria, main criteria to fund or not projects, depending on the extent to which the project is going to help an organization or a group to continue functioning in a in certain way. So when I talk about continuous functioning, it might be maintenance or it might be improving certain processes in an organization. So I have a couple of examples here that happened to me when I was in the industry and we decided to actually go and fund a series of projects that were going to help us to continuous the operation of the factory. In other words, we wanted to reach certain levels of the of spoilage and of productivity. And the only way that we were able to reach those was actually if we actually invest in the production line by bringing some devices that were able to check the quality of each can being produced in the factory.

So again, it is a it is a model in which the major criteria is to what extent the project is going to help us to continue to function and operate in this environment. The next module is the competitive base model and in this model is somehow overlapped with the previous one but is more into the strategic domain of the organization. In this one, the major criteria that drives decision makers is to what extent a given project is going to help the organization to remain competitive in its environment. So we call it the competitive base model. And in this model, what we are seeking is either to capitalize in an opportunity or to address a market threat. So those major criteria are actually what define if we would like to fund or not a project using this method. So, for example, there is the opportunity that a construction, a construction company had to go and buy certain piece of land and develop certain type of houses to go ahead and capitalize in the market. That was at that time and in that specifically in that region. And so they saw an opportunity and they addressed that opportunity by funding a large project that was going to develop a large piece of land that was beside that other new developments and shopping malls.

So it is competitive because if the company did not capitalize on that, then the competitors will go will go and do the same. And then of course, they will be in a better position in the market. The other one is one very strategic one that happened to the company that I was working several years ago, which is a company that produced crown caps for beer bottles. And these are actually sometimes aluminum, sometimes alloys that. I used to again to seal the bottle. What this the senior management of this organization found out is that and we're talking about ten, 15 years ago is that this new generation of plastic cap were coming and that sooner or later beer was going to be a bottle in plastic bottles. Nowadays, we are seeing more and more of these companies using. I mean, beer companies using plastic bottles to package their material. So what they did was actually to to create a strategic alliance with a company that produces plastic caps. And they open a shop of that company. And people were actually wondering why you did that. And they said, well, because sooner or later this company, which we work right now, is going to die and we need to be investing in what is coming next. So that that was a market trend that they saw and they went ahead and invested in this new company. Again, a major project because we're talking about a lot of million dollars to bring this new technology into this specific area of that country and move ahead and remain competitive in the market.

Finally, the last Non-numeric selection model that I want to cover is one that I have used a lot and most likely each of us have used it to a certain extent, but in a very tacit way. So meaning not in a very explicit way with really understanding of what we're doing. This model starts with a pool of projects or, let's say a pool of alternatives that we would like to judge. And from that pool of projects, we decide to either individually with some decision makers or as a group to take a look at them and. Categorize them into high level. Or really good ones and low levels or the not so good ones that we don't want to fund. After that, we take a look at the high level to see if we can find out some of those projects or alternatives that looks more into the low side and then move them into a pile that we call medium level. Same thing we do with the low level pie we see, well, these are the best one in this pile. So let's move this into a medium level pile. So then we have a high level, medium level and low level pi. Pi excuse me.

And then we get into the high level, the remaining ones, and take a deep look at them and decide which, which one seems to be the really best ones, the high. The higher level and then the ones that are not so good. So now we have two more levels. We don't do anything to the medium level and to the low level. We again take a deep look into it and try to sort them in low and very low level after we have done all this, the most important thing is that we take a look at each of these individual projects to see if they really belong to each of these categories. And of course, if necessary, we need to resort everything again. When we do this thing. As an individual. I mean yourself. It is an easy process. However, it may be a process that can take some time because of the amount of products that you need to go through. But when you do it in a group, a decision making team, you can take a. Longer, even though we have more people that can go through all this project faster. But it can take longer because of the dialogue that is going to exist to really define what is high level, medium level and low level. So in other words, when we go and do it individually, even though we think that it's going to take a long time, probably it will be faster than when we do it in a group.

I have done this many times and usually we always come back to Non-numeric project selection models after we have done some numeric project selection models. In other words, what I'm saying is that we engineers or decision analysts like to see a lot of numbers and crunch numbers to see really what is the best decision to go with. But sometimes we are not the ones that are going to make the decision and we need to send all this information to our decision maker. And he or she may take into consideration a a numeric the results of a numeric decision making process, but they may not too. And and they will end up using non-numeric project selection models in a. Non-numeric decision making process. So what we will see in reality in in the industry. Real world is a combination of non-numeric and numeric decision making models depending on how. Uh, stressful and dynamic is the environment sometimes. Decision makers even will neglect the use of numeric decision making models because of the time and effort that will take to go through that. And they will rely more on their intuition and they will go with the, again, numeric nonnumeric decision making model. So what we also call sometimes naturalistic decision making processes. So I would like that you think about for a few seconds about what are the strengths and weaknesses of this non-numeric selection models.

I already gave you some clues, but I would like you to think for a few seconds of what it is. So I would like you to pause the tape right now and think about that. And then. Continue with the tape and I'll give you some of my ideas with respect to these models. Okay. So what I think that are some of the major strengths and weaknesses of these models are. First of all, it can be perceived as biased and very subjective. And that's true because we don't have much support when we decide to go with one project, with with with another one. We have no numbers that we can show of why we think that one is better than the other one. However, the other the other side is also truth, which is they can speed up the decision making process because of the lack of processes that we need to go through. With the exception again of the last one, the Q-sort, that when you have a large decision making team, I mean a team that has many members, the dialogue that will be created by defining what is high, what is medium or what is low will take that process to to. To be very time consuming, for example. About a few months ago, we were actually deciding between different people that were going that was supposed to fill a position.

And we went through a numeric decision making process in which we looked at certain qualities of each of these individuals and we rank them. It took us a good three hours to crunch the numbers individually. And this is a group of four decision makers to crunch the numbers and create a rank and then to agree on that on that rank based on our results. The numeric results. We had a close group of the best ones that we had to decide which were the ones that we really would like to bring into the organization. So what happened was that then we went into a non-numeric decision making process that took us a good four or more hours to go through. It was really difficult for us to articulate why we thought that one was better than the other one. There was a lot of bias. There was a lot of of political issues going on because of the different level of powers and hierarchy that people had in that room. So. Are they perfect? I mean, the non-numeric decision making models? Well, probably not. But they can help in speed up the decision making process in certain occasions. So with this, I'm completing this first learning module on decision making models, which is non numeric decision making. In the next module, we will cover numeric decision making models and see you then.",2946,"[-0.01542473 -0.00858635  0.01162192 ... -0.01194216 -0.01642547

Structures of Project Organizations,6.0,PM,"Title: Structures of Project Organizations; Description: Module number six of the course discusses organizational structures and how they support projects. The module covers different ways organizations can be organized, such as by function, product, process, project, geography, customer, or time. It also explores the division of labor, coordination of efforts, and the questions that organizational structures must answer. The module introduces different types of structures, including functional, matrix, and pure project organizations. It discusses the trends in organizational structures, such as decentralization, self-organization, permeable boundaries, autonomy, and focus on learning and complexity. The module concludes by highlighting issues with organizational structures and how to determine if a structure is no longer effective, such as lack of coordination, conflicts, ambiguous roles, unresponsiveness, and low productivity. The importance of alignment, linking groups, and power allocation in organizational structures is also emphasized.; Transcript: Hello and welcome to module number six Organizational Structures. This is a very important module because it talks about how organizations actually house projects. And so we need to understand some basic concepts when we try to take a deep look into how organizations organize so that they can actually generate or provide capabilities to projects. So. Topics that we're going to cover in this first lecture includes organizational structure, project based structures and issues with the structure and project organizations. So we will talk about the questions that that organizational structure must answer and some forms that provide a support to projects and and to project based structures and some issues that we need to be aware that can help us to determine if a structure is not good anymore. So here are some questions that we would like to answer to Think about how do we organize so that we can actually house projects or support projects in organizations? How do we divide labor in organizations? How do we provide coordination in organizations? And just keep in mind that the these three questions provide different perspectives into the structure of our organization or how we actually bring people together and resources together so that we can achieve some goals and support some tasks. So how do we organize? There are different ways in which we can organize. Very generally speaking, we talk about formally and informally and we talk about formally. There are different ways that organizations have used to organize, and these are some of the most common doesn't means that you can find other ways to formally organize outside, but it's usually the first one by function and by function.

It means when you go to an organization and you see a group of people doing, let's say cryogenics and other group is doing electrical engineering and other groups doing mechanical engineering, you have an administration group that does accounting and let's say another group within the accounting will do taxes. So we organized by function. So we bring people together and put them to work in certain tasks that are pretty much the same thing for that group. The other way of organizing in a formal setting is by product. And you see this in usually in manufacturing organizations in which you have different products being generated in in different production lines. And then you have a group of people that focus, let's say in a 12 ounce packages and another one will focus, let's say in one liter packages. And again, it depends on depending on the product, you have different groups working to generate a certain item. The other one is by process. And if we broke down function product, we may get to the level of a process. And then you have people working within a specific set of tasks, within a large organization, within a large group. And usually these are, let's say if we're talking about the can manufacturing plant. We're talking about the ones that are going to be working in molding the aluminum and other ones may be working in the process that provides a coating inside the can.

Another group may be working on the decoration of the can outside. So depending on the process, you group people so that you. Coordinate and give some assignments and to to a group of people to generate generate some work. The other one is by project. And this is very common in project based organizations in which there are different projects going on at the same time. And depending on the size of the organization, it can be 1 or 2 projects or hundreds of projects going on at the same time. And so we may organize again projects that goes to to do, let's say, certain achieve certain tasks, maybe marketing projects, or there may be construction projects, maybe continuous improvement projects so we can organize again by project. The other one is by geography. That helps the organization to give certain tasks to certain people in different locations. It is very common nowadays that very large organizations and some small ones to big in to hire people outside the country. And and there are many reasons why they would like to do this, of course. One is because they might be cheaper labor someplace else. But there is one more important reason of why this can be done, and that is that when you have a certain project or certain task that needs to be done, you have the time limitation.

In other words, what I'm saying. We work usually between 8 to 12 hours a day and that's it. And the organization needs to close. If you really want to give the opportunity to have 24 over seven, let's say, customer service capability, and then you need to find out different people that would like to work in different time zones so that you keep that capability going on. Another important one is when you need to do some work and and you find out that the normal time tend to 12 hours a day is not going to be enough to accomplish certain tasks, then you can bring people from another time zones so that your actual day of work is not the 10 hours or 12 hours. We pretty much can be talking about 24 hours every day of work that can be taking place in a given project. Of course, that will increase your capability and will increase your velocity to generate some products. The other one is by customer. This is very common to in project based organizations. I did a technical assistant to a medium sized organization in which they pretty much have different groups working in different projects and they could not talk to each other because the customers were actually competitors. So they had to sign very strict clauses in their contracts in which all these people needs to be separated within the same organization.

So that again is a good example of how people working within the same organization can be organized to work in customers and you are not able to talk to anyone but those that works with the same customer and finally buy time. So it depends on when things are going to happen. Organizations can actually have a group of people focusing on what's going to happen within this month or next year and in different time zones. Another important topic here in how do we organize this? How do we organize informally? That is when we have self organizations. There is a really nice research coming out of a shop floor in which a group of researchers began to look at how this group was informally organized or self-organized, and they thought that actually there was a self organization. If you look at a group that is self-organized, how they actually come up and coordinate and achieve some work, it seems to be very chaotic. Everybody is running around and everybody seems to not have something clear on how to do. However, what these researchers found is that whenever a new task was given to this group in this work shop floor, they all went to the same person to ask for assistance. So in other words, even though it was an informally organized group, there was a leader within that group that was the person with most experience on how to do this task, to which everybody went and asked for help.

And this person very informally was managing the whole group. So nowadays there is this topic of Agile project management that we're going to talk towards the end of this course. And one of the major changes that this Agile project management domain is proposing is that project teams needs to be self-organized. And that's a big change. However, it has been found to be very effective in generating work and satisfaction within the team. So what is the difference between formal and informal? Well. When we have formal organization, formal task, we always need to think about that. That task is going to make those involved in the task accountable. In other words, if you do something that is a formal communication, a formal task, you are going to be accountable for whatever you do or you didn't do. But when we talk about informal communication, informal task, then there is no way in which you can pinpoint who is responsible or accountable for certain work. So we need to define what is accountability. And accountability is the combination of authority and responsibility. So I give you authority. You have a role and obligation. I gave you a title. I gave you the role of project manager. And however, to in order for you to really be accountable for your work, I also need to give you power. So you need to be empowered to do your task. Because if I give you the title of project manager but do not give you the means to do your work, you are in few words, not accountable for anything that happens there.

So we need to give our team both things. They need to have a role within the team and they need to have the ability or the power to do their task so that we can actually say that they can be accountable for what they do or for what they don't do. And same thing with the project manager. We need to have the responsibility and the authority to do our work. The next one is the division of labor. How do we divide labor in organization? So there are different ways and again, this is not a all what all the different ways that you can find outside, but these are the ones that are more likely to be applied by organization. The first one is horizontal. You may have different group of people doing the same thing and in other words, you have a set of project managers or you have a set of teams, but you have a set of engineers. The other one is a vertical in which you have subordinates and supervisors reporting back and forth, up and down, spatial, going back again, different locations. You might have different people that are completely independent or that are totally dependent on each other working in different locations. And it is important to note that when you bring these three variables horizontal, vertical and spatial, when you have so many lines of communication, so many levels of hierarchy, you pretty much are going to be increasing the complexity of the organization and therefore may be hampering the communication and the coordination of work.

So keep that in mind because a large organization is very difficult to coordinate. The next one is coordination of efforts. So how do we make sure that we coordinate effort across the whole organization? Well, there are three different ways of doing it that you can find outside the organization. There might be some other ones again, but these are the most common. The first one is by formalization or standardization. You pretty much do a good upfront work trying to understand how people are going to interact with each other. So you create policies, norms, procedures of what it is that we are supposed to do when and how and. But the problem with this is that sometimes we find out that we need to be flexible and that we need to accommodate new things happening on the run. So this type of of a plan on how we do things may apply for environments that are very stable. The other one is by centralization. You bring someone with enough power in certain location and this person is going to be the decision maker and make sure that he or she coordinates the work that is going on. The project manager is very much a centralized power of decision.

He or she is going to be coordinating across all the stakeholders. What's going to happen, how it's going to happen. And the other one is range of control in which certain project managers or leaders are given the ability to coordinate small group of people or a large group of people so that they achieve certain tasks or certain work. So and again, this can be hierarchical too. When you bring a, let's say, a one level in which 100 people is going to be manage and then an upper level in which thousands of people are going to be managed, and then maybe an upper upper level in which we're talking about hundreds of thousands of people being managed or coordinated in an organization. So again, three basic approaches on how we can actually coordinate some work to be done in organizations. So let's talk now about the organizational structures that houses projects. The first one is the functional structure. Remember when I talk about that, we differentiate by function. So here is a good example. This is a very common in organization that have manufacturing facilities or manufacturing service services offer. And usually you have a large group of people call to work in an engineering department. Then you have another group of people working in the manufacturing department or in operations and another group of people working in marketing and another group of people working in administration.

Another 1st May be in quality assurance and. In this type of organizations, projects are not common. In other words, what I'm saying is that. The way in which they operate has been set for what they need to produce. They do not produce their services or their products by projects. They do it through a manufacturing process. So you have lines, production lines, for example, we can recall or imagine a industry in which we are producing cars that go through a production line. So these are not projects. This is a continuous production of, of, of a product. However, in this type of organizations, we may find that they need to have certain projects. Let's say not so often. And these projects are going to be focused, let's say, in implementing new changes in the production line or actually building a new production line. These are usually a large project in this type of organizations or trying to put a new product outside might be a marketing project or might be a new design research and development project going on in the engineering side of the organization. In any of these cases, the organization is not able to support a project very well. A project is usually brought on to the line managers, which are usually called those that manage or administer the large group of people. So these line managers and the general manager will assign a project manager that will report to them. However, this project manager is more like an administrator and he or she may not have enough power to say how things are going to happen and when things are going to happen.

He's just brought there to coordinate the effort, so he pretty much reports to the different functions, line managers and the general manager on how things actually are going. So we call this a weak project structure because the project manager really do not have a lot of power. Then because of the issues that were found in functional organization housing projects, someone came up with the idea of what about if we built a matrix organization? And a lot of organizations began to develop little by little, adapt their organizations to a point in which they came up with what is called the Matrix organization or the matrix structure. And so what we're seeing here, and it's important that you remember the lines. Refer to. Two important things, at least. One is communication back and forth. And the other thing are resources. And when we talk about resources, we're talking about human resources, we're talking about raw resources. And we also may talk about some technical assistance or technical resources or technical direction of what's going on. So what we see here is that we have a new item up in the line manager level, which is the project management office, A project management office houses several projects and project managers, and there is a project manager, office officer, which is the one that supervises the project managers of the projects in that office.

There are also some functional structures or some functional groups, let's say engineering, production, marketing administration and all these groups provide assistance to the projects and we see the projects are going and cutting across the lines coming down from the functional departments, from engineering and production. So pretty much what's going on there is that the project manager is coordinating the effort that goes in the horizontal line and that cut across different functions in the organization. So there are two different types of metrics. One is a strong matrix and the other one is the weak matrix. The strong matrix is when the project manager has enough power upon the project to define the resources that he is going to get. And when I say define, he or she may be able to say, I would like to have a Michael in this project because he's the best programmer or I don't want to have a Peter because he really do not do a good job or we don't get along that way or we don't communicate that well. He has a different style than the one that I have. So and also it's about I would like to perform this task in this project in this way, and I would like to use this procedure. I would like to use this standards. And when a project manager has that amount of power is when we talk about we are in the presence of a strong matrix organization.

On the other side. The weak Matrix organization is when the project manager has a little power upon what needs to happen and how it needs to happen. The line managers, I mean the engineering managers and maybe the, let's say the electrical engineering management or the mechanical engineering management, the aerospace manager will. Tell the project manager how things are going to happen, actually. He's even a little bit more complex because. They assign people in the vertical lines into that project that they may change at any time and that they provide different direction on how things actually are going to happen. So people working within projects in a matrix organization will find out that they sometimes have two bosses, the project manager coming out of the project management office and the engineering or the line manager that will tell them how things actually are going to happen. So this structure, even though provides a lot of power and a lot of flexibility to the project manager, it also increases the chances of conflict going on between the project manager and the line managers or between the line managers and the and the project team. So even though, again, it supports better projects because it enhances communication and enhances the technical ability of the project, it also opens the possibility to have a lot of conflicts, which happens very often. The other really important structure that we need to talk about.

Is the pure project organization. Uh, again, this is a. A continuum that has been going on in organizations. They usually started as a functional organization. Then they went into a major organization as a weak matrix, then change it to a strong matrix. And then because of the amount of conflicts that happen in this matrix organization, they decided to go and move into a pure project organization. In this pure project organization, you have a project management office or a program management office that houses different project managers, but also houses a different group of people, a pool of resources that might be a pool of human resources and a raw resources office space materials and at the project manager has complete power on what things needs to happen and how things are going to happen. He or she doesn't report to any line manager but to the program manager. However he or she needs to be very well versed in many different items of organization. I mean, if this is a technical organization, he or she may be a very good engineer and having really good understanding on the products that he or she or they are going to produce, for example, pretty much what I'm saying is that he needs to understand very well the technical sides of the organization. And so it's very difficult to find project managers that cut across different disciplines. In other words, what I'm saying that are good mechanical engineering, electrical engineers or good administrators and good marketeers.

So they will really need to have a huge capability in order to lead these projects. So that's a downside of this organization. However, the good side is that the communication is streamlined and there is a less chances that it generates conflicts in the organization. Okay. So let's talk about some issues with the organizational structures. What is the right structure to our organization. So that's a very difficult question. It depends on many different things. What are our goals? And remember, when we talk about goals, we usually have a timeline. So what do we want to accomplish now in five years, ten years? And that can define how we actually bring people together? What's our strategy, how we align our resources to the task that we want to accomplish in a short, medium and long term? How dynamic is our environment? Do we compete in an environment that is stable or we compete in an environment that we have? First competition. I'm not trying to actually shut us down at any point of time. Is it a dynamic environment? Is that static environment? So those are questions that will help us to actually bring structure that is more aligned to what things are going to happen to this organization in the months ahead. Technology. Are we using stable technology or this is actually a new technology all the time. So in other words, we have seen how organizations competing in environments that are very complex that change a lot, in which technology defines who is going to be the one providing the latest product.

Pretty much. I'm talking about the software industry. Therefore, we need to have an organization that is. Very responsive, responsive of anything that's going to happen outside. So bureaucracy needs to be kept at the minimum, and they need to be able to reorganize very quickly every time that a new thing happens in the environment. And finally, resources, how much resources we have. So one that really defines the structure is the amount of people that we have and the capabilities that they have. So all that will help us to really pinpoint the right structure and what are the mechanisms that support the structure? Well, there are many, and the most important one is communication, the culture of the organization and the processes that we have defined to use in achieving certain goals through the accomplishment of certain tasks. The last question. How will we know if it is no longer the right structure? There is a slide coming up on that. So I would like you to begin to think about how do we know it is not the right structure anymore to the organization? So here are some trends of organizational structures that are coming more in the future. The first one, we are becoming more decentralized and this may not be a big surprise to any of you because it has been already happening for a long time.

We are talking about the dynamic nature of structure and being self-organized, and this is really a big change that is coming up to the project environment and that I believe in the next few years is going to be more and more common in certain organizations. There is a lot to be to be changed to accept this type of structures. But when you see the big changes that they produce in terms of capabilities and performance, I think that those changes are going to hold very well. Permeable boundaries in which teams are not any more or groups are not any more supposed to be working within four walls. They are assumed to be able and they are expected to be able to cut across the boundaries of organizations to find the resources that they need to work. And resources may be money, but may also be information and knowledge autonomy. This is a very well related to the self-organization. When you provide a group of people the ability to do their work in the way that they think is the best way that needs to be done. So there is a not a lack, but there is a minimum oversee from management and they work in this type of structures independently and they come up with the decision that they believe is the best for the team. And again, it has been found to work very well in organizations.

The other one emphasis on on design and management of the informal structure, again, we are seeing that the managers are now changing the way in which they look at structures and accepting more and more that informal structures again is a big change. But they have seen that it provides a good enough capabilities to organization to actually be able to assume that that new thing is going to happen. In other words, what I'm saying is that there have been some very nice stories about project managers that have changed the way in which they do manage their projects. And they go again, I'm going to this story because I think that is really good. They put together this new informal structure and give it to a team. And the team is totally self organized empower. They have all the knowledge needed within the team, which is called a cross-functional team. And one day the manager came to see how they were working. And one of the members of the team looked back and say, What are you doing here? So what? I'm the project manager and I came to see how things are going and they say, well, everything is going fine. We don't need you, so go and find something else to do. And so again, that's a good explanation that when you empower them and they feel that they have the capabilities that they need, they will do the work with less supervision, which is again, good and bad.

You just need to be sure that that you trust them and everything will be fine. And if not, you can actually help them and coach them in the beginning. But towards the end we are moving to towards an ideal in which there is less supervision and more trust in their capabilities. Then the last two is focus on learning and complex organization, what is called also complex adaptive organization in which we have a very complex structure. However, that structure changes based on what they learn and based on the environment. So we're talking about that a concept of a complex adaptive system or system of systems. So which I really would like you to look more into that because it's a very fascinating topic on how organizations become complex adaptive systems. So let's talk about now the issues in project organization. How do we know if the organization is not good anymore? So there is no coordination. We don't know what needs to be done, who is in charge and how things are going to take place. So there is a lot of conflicts going on across the line managers or line managers with the team or within the team or within the team. And the project manager is just it seems like at any minute there are two or more conflicts going on in that project. Ambiguous role. We don't know what we are supposed to do.

Again, there is no organization and of course all that will lead into not using our resources and our processes in the most effective way. And so in other words, our input may be 100, but our outputs are going to be 2 or 3 units, which is not good. So we need to have a high outputs based on the inputs that we have and we are not able to respond to any new needs or any demand coming out of the environment. So we are pretty much an organization that has become static and totally unproductive. So again, when we see lack of communication, lack of of coordination, too much conflicts, people wandering around what they need to do at a point of time, the amount of investment actually is too high for what we can actually generate. And so immediately we know there is something going on here and an easy way to actually look at this, see the amount of project that has to be cancelled in an organization and see the size of the project and see how come we are canceling these large programs. If we were supposed to be okay with the funds that we receive. So those are again, questions that we need to ask when we begin to see an organization going into that direction. So summary. So if I. If I had to recommend you. One slide that you need to remember very much from this learning module is this one coming up.

So whenever we talk about organizational structures, always remember these four bullets. The first one is how the structure group people remember that or how the organization is going to group people. How to structure link the different groups of people. So the key word here, groups and the other key word links across groups. Then the third one, how the structure is aligned to the strategic plan. So how that structure that we have is aligned to where the organization is going and how the organization wants things to be accomplished. So the key word here is alignment between the structure and what the organization wants to accomplish and the environment, of course. And finally, how power is allocated and distributed in the structure. So in other words, how we look at the politics of that organization and how power is granted and how power is used by the people and by the groups within that organization so that they accomplish their task. So these are key words here. Alignment linked groups and power or politics are important to be considered. Every time that we have to study the structure of an organization that houses projects. Okay, so with this, we complete our module number six and provide again a good background on how the organization that houses the project actually coordinate work and organize people so that the project work is accomplished and the project objectives are achieved. So I will see you in module number seven. That is coming up next. Thank you.",6031,"[-0.01384832  0.00467397 -0.00271529 ... -0.01253817 -0.01349458

Culture of Projects and Project-based Organizations,7.0,PM,"Title: Culture of Projects and Project-based Organizations; Description: Organizational culture plays a crucial role in effective project management. It is defined as the shared beliefs, values, and way of doing things within a company. Organizational culture is developed by groups in order to cope with problems and adapt to external demands. However, it can be distinct from national culture. 
In the module, Southwest Airlines is presented as a case study where a change in leadership raised concerns about potential cultural changes. This demonstrates how changing a leader can have a significant impact on organizational culture. Additionally, there is a relationship between national culture, organizational culture, and project cultures, all of which can affect project environments. Different national cultures can impact how organizations behave and perform in projects. 
To illustrate this, the module shares examples from Asia, where cultural differences have had notable impacts. In one example, peer pressure was used to motivate better performance in a production line. In another instance, personal relationships were prioritized over qualifications when bringing in suppliers, leading to potential issues for American companies operating in China. Project managers need to be aware of and accommodate these cultural differences to ensure successful project outcomes. 
Cultural clashes can occur when implementing a new culture in a project team, as different cultures have different ways of working. Project managers must understand and accommodate these differences to effectively manage multiple projects simultaneously. Cultural analysis can be done by examining the products and processes of an organization. Tangible products and processes can reveal the values and goals upheld by a culture. Leaders must also recognize and reward behaviors that align with the desired culture to communicate the organization's values. 
The importance of understanding and navigating different cultures for successful project management is emphasized throughout the module. Two stories are shared to further illustrate the impact of culture on project management. One story highlights the difficulties faced when negotiating a contract in a foreign country due to a lack of understanding of cultural norms. The second story focuses on Walt Disney World and how its cultural emphasis on meeting deadlines over cost and quality originated from an incident involving Walt Disney himself. These stories emphasize how leaders can shape a company's culture and the significance of understanding cultural influences in the workplace. 
The module concludes by emphasizing the importance of analyzing organizational culture and its impact on project performance and team satisfaction. Module 8 will delve deeper into these topics. Overall, understanding and accommodating different cultures is crucial for successful project management.; Transcript: Hi. Welcome to module number seven. Culture. And we are going to be talking about this very soft concept of organizational cultures and how that is important to be recognized and understood very well if we want to become a effective and efficient project manager. So topics that we are going to cover include organizational culture and project culture. Talk about the concept of culture, and we're also going to talk about the elements and a context for a project and the relationship between context and content and how that is important to be recognized in culture and understand how we can actually conduct cultural analysis of an organization. So let's first define what is organizational culture, which is different from national culture. And we will see in a few minutes what do I mean? Here are some very good cultural definitions that. I have used in the past to explain what it is a culture, the shared beliefs and values, its distinct identity. I mean its distinct organizational identity. It's the social glue holding the company together. It's the way we do things around here. This one I like a lot because whenever you join a new group or a new organization, you always have people coming and very informally telling you, Well, this is the way that we do things around here. It's pretty much telling you this is the culture that we have in this organization. However, the definition that has been more widely used in academia and by and by some practitioners is Shine's definition, as you can see, is the more sophisticated one.

And it is very dense, but again, it provides the right information that helps us define what is culture. So I'll go step by step. Bullet by bullet to explain what it is. Shine defines culture as a pattern of basic assumptions, so there is nothing written. It is a social phenomenon that goes into an organization in which you are assumed to behave in certain ways, but there is nothing that you can actually find written on how you are supposed to behave. It is just word of mouth, how people are have told you what they are expecting you to do. It is also call in psychology the psychological contract. So when we go into an organization the first time they tell you, yeah, you're going to be making X amount of money and I'll pay you. We will pay you bi weekly or monthly or daily. And you are expected to work during the weekends. But we don't pay over time. And you are expected that if we need you at any time during the day or during the weekend or during the night that you come to try to solve the problems that are going on in the organization. So pretty much what they are saying is that these are assumptions that are not written in the contract and that they are expecting that you perform at that level, that they will tell you.

Next bullet is invented or discovered or developed by a given group. So a culture is usually a group phenomenon. I haven't seen a culture in an individual. This is only at a group level. And and the group is the one that because of the issues that they are having, they had to figure out how to best work together. So they invented that ways of working together or discovered better ways of working together or develop the way that they work together through time and the next bullet. As the group learns to cope with their problems and external adaptation and internal integration, remember context and content. So how they actually go and adapt, what's going on within the project depending on the demands that they are receiving from the environment and the demands may be from the customer, but also from the line managers. On what are the technical codes that they need to apply, let's say within that project team and within the products and services that they are building. And the fourth bullet that has worked well enough to be considered valid. And that means that if a team or a group of people in an organization have developed a new way of doing things. But you know what? That new way is just it has been working for just only a week. So it is not. It has not affected the culture of that organization yet.

Let's put it that way. So in order to to a new assumption or a new structure, a new norm to behold within the culture of an organization, it had to be applied for a good enough time so that the group can tell anyone coming up. And again, that's the fifth bullet, anyone that is going to be joining the group, Hey, this is the way in which we work around here, because that's the way in which we have seen that we have, let's say let's conflict. People are more happy and we are more effective working in this way. So usually when you have people that comes with different culture and joining an organization that has a culture that is very different from the culture that that giving person or a group is bringing, we talk that we have cultural clashes, and in cultural clashes, things sometimes get personal. There is a lot of conflict and there is nothing actually accomplished or very little being accomplished at a very poor level quality level. So and so it is been taught to new members as the correct way to think, perceive, act, behave with respect to the problems and normal work that happens in that organization pretty much every day. So as as I told you, this is a very dense definition, but it pretty much brings every little item within the phenomenon of organizational culture. Another important thing to keep in mind is that even though we may have a culture in an organization, we also are going to have within that organization a subculture.

It is very likely that these subcultures are going to be developed within groups. And because of many reasons, sometimes it's because, again, we are grouping the organization by function. So you have engineers talking in their same language in the same way that they were educated. You may have accountants or the administration group developing their own way of doing things, but in general, what really defines the culture or subculture in an organization or in groups is the leader of that group. So the fastest way to change a culture is by changing the leader or the manager or the CEO of that organization. So there is a very nice case that I recommend you to look at if you are more interested in the culture of organizations. The case is about Southwest Airlines, when several years ago, probably ten plus years ago, the CEO was about to retire because he got sick and had to go through treatment. So someone else had to be elected CEO or they need to hire a new one. And they were debating if they had to bring someone from outside or it had to be someone from inside. Of course, when you bring someone from someone from outside and you have develop a very nice culture like the culture that Southwest developed and still have nowadays.

So of course, there is a big danger there because those assumptions, norms and behaviors that people have developed throughout time, we're going to be most likely changed by this new leader that may direct the organization in doing new things or different things. And again, it is perceived by people working in the organization as a big threat. The other option was to bring someone from inside, but it has to be, again, as respected as the previous person, a leader that was about to to go. In this case, a herb is the first name of that past CEO of of Southwest. So the article that you can find if you can do a search online, is a who's going to replace Herb And they talk about how he developed this very nice culture and how the organization was really apprehensive in he leaving and who was going to be elected next. So at that time, when they wrote the article, they didn't know who was going to be the replacement. So nowadays we know that that the person that took the job or was given the CEO position was actually his assistant. And and she has been leading Southwest successfully for the last years. And it turned out to be the right decision because they kept that culture within the organization. And. The organization has been again doing better. Another important thing that we need to understand is that there is usually a relationship between the national culture and the organizational culture and the organizational culture and the divisions, cultural subcultures.

And they all can trickle down to have good or bad. Environments within your project culture. So we may also have project cultures. Again, just remember, we have a group of people and we have a leader. And remember what I told you in the previous module. The project manager is like the CEO of this small organization, so he may set up a different type of cultures in in in different projects. Again, depending on what the project is going to be accomplished and the resources that are available and the environment. So a national culture, for example, we know that in Asian countries we have national cultures that really define how people actually work there. They have long hours and they praise. They have a lot of. Moral obligations in the way they do work. In other words, we have seen how a lot of people in Asian countries have committed suicide after something actually went wrong in their companies. There is also this very nice example of how in a production line they. And they have a board in one of the close by walls that has the control chart that looks at how the production line actually has been doing in that particular shift that's going on at that time. And and of course, you see the line going up and down, meaning high or low efficient or high or low spoilage going on in that production line.

But the beauty of this thing is that, again, bring the national culture into the work organization that they have. Place pictures of those working in that shift. In other words, if you pass by and see that the line going down, then it is very a very ineffective shift. You immediately see the faces of the ones working in that shift and provide a little bit of peer pressure or make them feel ashamed of their poor performance and this type of peer pressure. Again, moral obligation in these type of cultures, national cultures works very well. And it's against define how things actually are going to happen in in at work. The other important thing is that we need to understand that national cultures impact a lot the project. There are many cases in which we are going to be working with people from different countries and they will bring into the team their basic assumptions and their basic beliefs. And we need to accommodate this type of of people as much as we can. There is a very nice case within the book that talks about this phenomenon called Guanzi, a g, u A and x Y, which is a phenomenon that happens in China. And this is a very good example of a national culture and how people in China are expected to give work or to bring suppliers in the company.

So they're friends first. In other words, if am let's say now a manager and I need to hire a contractor, I will hire the contractors that are my close friends or within my network, my professional network, and which is good and bad. It is good because I have known them very well and we have some relationship and that means that we may have some leverage in terms of how things are going to happen and how much are we going to be paying. However, if these are really bad suppliers or contractors and I'm just hiring them because they are my close friends, then of course, the organization is going to be affected. And again, this is the phenomenon in one Z. I don't look into the Yellow Pages to find someone. I look into my network to get the ones that I know. It doesn't matter if they provide a bad product and a higher price. And so there are cases in which this culture have provided the enough seats to lawsuits across American organizations doing work in China. Why? Because it was expected by the American culture that the Chinese people was going to behave like American cultures, like an American working in China, but in reality was that they were making the decisions based on their culture. So again, this one case provides a lot of good background on this particular problem when we don't understand it.

So how can we go around, let's say, if we know that this one phenomenon happens? Well, you need to be sure that you don't provide this type of decision making capabilities to anyone working in China, or that if you are going to delegate this type of capabilities, that you supervise them very closely so that they understand that there are certain limitations that happen when they work for American companies. And the other thing that I want to talk about with respect to organizational culture is how the environment or the national culture will influence a lot, how things happen within the organization. I challenge you to ask or to do a search online to find out what is called a siesta. Siesta is written as I. E. S t. S and Tom a siesta. This is a phenomenon that happens in Spain and. This phenomenon is as simple as that. The people in early afternoon go and have a nap. And yes, you hear me? Well, they go and have a nap in the middle of the day because it is it is their culture. So there are a lot of stories of people going in and in a bus and out of a sudden the driver just stop and say, well, everybody goes out, I'm going to have a nap. And so you need to understand that these type of phenomenons actually happen in organizations. And because, again, these organizations are set up in different countries will affect how your project is going to perform.

There is another really important example that took place many years ago, and it is about this project that that Walt Disney put together to open a new park in Europe. And they pick Paris and they call that park in the beginning, Euro Disney. And so what they found was, first of all, that they were working with French people and they have very strict rules on how they work in that country. In other words, you can be in trouble and even sue if you work over time in that country without the approval of the of the union, if you can get approval. So we are used to have a daily working hours that goes from 8 to 12 or sometimes even more than 12 hours a day. So over there, it's 5:00 pm. You are out of your desk no matter what is going on in the project. And that brought a humongous amount of trouble to that project because things were not getting done. And of course, and then later on, what they found is that the title Euro Disney was not that pleased to Parisians, so they changed the name to Disneyland Paris to actually accommodate more the American culture in the in Paris. So, again, a lot of important stories that I want to share. There is another good one that it is it is really difficult to tell.

But that, again, the the book makes a reference somehow to it, which is when you do work with the countries in which they have very strict rules on how you should behave in in in the social environment. So in particular, there is this story about the again, this is a my story that is again somehow related in the book that a person went to do some technical assistance in an Arab country and stayed there for six months. So he brought his wife to visit him and they went out to have some drinks that night, some food. I don't remember exactly the story, but they went out and she was not wearing the custom dress that the ladies had to wear in that country. So someone approached the person and they were a fight that broke up. And there was a big issue with this incident of people being put to jail. And because, again, they were not behaving using the basic assumptions of that country. And if this person was your project manager, that star that had to be there or let's say this was member of your project team, that was very critical for the performance of this project over there. So that means that you just need to find another one and that the project is in trouble. So and that's why organizations nowadays are bringing some people to provide training in in the different aspects of the culture in which you're going to be working at.

And sometimes you may think that this is a big investment. Let's say you are paying someone 80,000, $100,000 a year to train and help not only the person that is working in this project overseas, but also the family, which is very important too. But when you have projects that cost millions of dollars and the input of one of these person can put the project in danger, $100,000 a year is nothing to prevent something like this happen. Another important topic that I want to talk about is this issue of certain countries in Europe that have the culture, the national culture that trickle down into their organizational culture that they stop working for A full month usually happens in August every summer. So if you are expecting to do some work in Europe during summer and somehow cut across the monophagous, you know that nothing is going to happen there. So we need to understand the issue of international projects and the national cultures that we're going to be touching because they can put our project in danger at any point of time. In other words, they can affect our project capabilities and our project performance. So what is the challenge for project managers? We need to quickly develop a culture that promotes the project objectives objectives. Is that easy to do? There's no way that we can say that it's easy to do.

However, we have seen how very charismatic leaders begin to provide direction, a vision of what we need to do and how we accomplish things. And usually they build that culture by example so people follow and mimic what the leaders actually do. And the other thing is that we need to understand the cultures and subcultures within the departments, because let's if we are working in a matrix organization, the members of the project teams that are coming, let's say we are bringing electrical engineers and then they are coming from the electrical engineering department, they are coming with that subculture of that electrical engineering department. But now you have a different culture that you would like to implement in that project team. They may have cultural clashes. In other words, you may be you may have a culture in which they are more open to voice what they need to do. You may have a culture in which you are open in terms of giving them power and that things will happen in the way that they think it should happen. But you may have teams that they say, Well, no, my boss used to tell me what I had to do and and now if you leave me without direction and ask me to do what I think, to do what I need to do, I may not do anything. And again, this is something that's going on in large organizations nowadays. When you have issues of national cultures, in some cultures, the manager needs to be all the time supervising and pretty much yelling to the people what they need to do.

Some other cultures, you can leave the team by themselves and they will figure out how to work. And again, we need to understand these different ways in which work is performed in organizations, in countries and in subgroups or divisions in organizations and. The other thing is that we need to understand and sustain cultures in different projects at the same time. Most likely we are not going to be the managers of a single project, but the manager of different projects that may be going on in parallel, which means that remember the culture we usually develop because of the type of resources that we have available and the type of objectives that we need to accomplish because of our style as managers as well and because of the environment in which we are. So we began to develop a culture that might be more flexible of a culture, that might be more into you do what I need to, what you do, what I told you to do immediately. So it depends on what's going on in the project and therefore you may need to switch gears depending on when you are into one project and going to another project. So when we talk about culture and projects, we have seen different cultures going on.

And one is a that has one that has been recognized as the power culture in which there is a single person that is a decision maker and everybody needs to go through this person. There is the role culture in which we have a lot of people doing different functions and pretty much builds a bureaucracy. We have the task culture, which is the one that must mimic what happened in a project, and we will see in the next slide what is based power is based on expertise and on education. And the other one is the person culture in which we focus on people more than in task and more in power. But we have seen, and I again recommend you to go and do a search online of what are the different cultures that exist in organizations. And you will see that there are many different types of cultures, but in the end they all pretty much explain the same phenomenon. And as as I show here on the screen in this particular article, Anderson uses Handy's, which uses Harrison's typologies of cultures. So again, there are different ones and and and they are pretty much explaining the same thing. But a task culture is one that. In which in which the team is not allowed to get distracted from accomplishing a task. That's the best way to recognize a project. You are working in an environment in which in which you have limited resources and in which you have a lot of things to do.

So if you delay your task, the project may get delayed and you may not be using your resources and your time efficiently. So there should be nothing that distracts the team from accomplishing the task. And so and the quote on top is a culture in which the dominant objective is to complete the job with the cooperative effort of the people working in there and which may possess different expertise. So it recognized that nothing is going to be accomplished by a single individual, but by cooperation across different individuals with different expertise that they are bringing together to do some job. So let's talk now about how we can analyze cultures. So there is this sense of. Symbols. Forms of social control, subcultures and basic assumptions. All that will help us to understand the culture of an organization. So we can look at the products of the culture and we can look at the processes of the culture. When we look at the products, these are pretty much tangible things that we can see. For example, I went into this company to do some technical assistance, some consulting, and the first thing that I saw in the hull was this big sign saying 90% of all our projects this year have been on time. So immediately that tells you that that company provides a big value on that specific goal. So everything should be done in a way that supports accomplishing that, that goal of of meeting a project deadline.

So that is again, a very tangible way in which you can see that the culture that that they have is that they work in a very time demanding compressed schedule. So we need to look also at symbolic goods and commodities. And in the military, we have seen this very well in terms of the flags that they use, the seals that they use, the recognition or the insignias that they that they wear and why they wear. For example, we all know what is behind a medal of Honor or the Purple Heart medal and and all this. Again, it comes out of recognizing the behavior of someone that matches very clearly the culture of that of the organization. Uh, one thing that I learned when I did some research in organizational behavior is that we leaders or managers of organizations have the opportunity to recognize these people that really exerted the behavior that we want everybody to have in an organization and call them, let's say, the employee of the month or the, uh, the novice of the year. We need to come up with ways in which can help us to provide rewards and promotions to those that really mimic the type of behavior that we want in an organization. And that behavior, again, supports the culture that we want to implement the organization and the vision that we would like to implement in the organization.

So we can use rewards and promotions to communicate to other people what is really value. And in an organization, we also have seen how people or organizations have used slogans to bring people together. When I joined one of my organizations, the organizations that I work in the past, one of the persons came to me and pretty much said that this is how we work here. But he said in a different way. He said, Hey, you know what? Around here we don't work hard, we work smart, so we make things happen. And so very soon after that, I found out that they not only work hard, but you need to work smart because they give you a lot of work. And there was no other way around the task that you have to do without working hard. And and again, you need to work smart. It was nothing was going to be accomplished. The only way to analyze an organization is by looking at the processes. This is a little bit more difficult because you need to see and observe things going on at that particular time. It's very abstract. There is fuzzy, but it's very interesting when you see these type of things happening. I had a student that told me that he had to negotiate a lot of contracts with the Japanese people, and he said that the first time that he went to Japan and tried to negotiate this contract, what he found was that the the conversation began to go in tangents.

It was never specifically focused on the issues or classes of the contract. And just he found that last day that he had to be there, that nothing has been accomplished and that he had to return to the country where he was from. And and he had to rush the discussion of these issues just to find out that he was in a really bad position to negotiate and that the they were in a good position because they didn't have to go anywhere. So, of course, that contract negotiation didn't go that well and he was not happy and the boss was not that happy to. So quickly, he found that the approach that they were taking was one of a conversation to deviate the conversation and not get to the discussion that he wanted to get until the last minute so that they have power to influence the decisions. So what he recommended me to do and the other students in the class was never say when you're going to leave. And and if you say have a backup plan of staying there a few more days in case what you had to negotiate was not that the at the level that you want. So again, a very soft way of in which we can see how the cultural product of a country trickle down in the organization, how actually things happen.

So there are other ways in which you see how people behave. My brother went into a training course that lasted three months. Outside his house, so he had to go to Detroit and join a group of 15 more people that came from around the world. And a month before his departure, he got a. Pretty much guidelines of how he had to behave when he was in the group. And I do remember one particular one that really got my attention, which he was not supposed to cross his legs and show the soles of his shoes to any Asian looking people because there are certain cultures in which they will get offended if you are showing them the sole of your shoe. So again, it's just a way to understand that culture is not only tangible things that we can look at and products or or insignias, but it's also how we behave and how people behave. And we need to. Understand that that may influence the people that you are working with and consequently may influence the capabilities and the performance of your project. So think about right now, the culture that has been developed in your current workplace or the previous workplace and how we have set is linked to that culture. What are the products of that culture that you were in or that you are in, and what are the processes going on in that culture? So give you a few seconds to think about that and and.

I think that this is a very important module because it really relates the social side of project management to the performance of the project and the satisfaction of anyone working in the team. Before I close this module, I would like to tell you one more story that I found very interesting, and it really gives you a good example of how people affect the culture of an organization, and particularly of how the CEO or the leader of an organization can affect the culture of an organization. In that year and the years to come, I was working in a project within Walt Disney World IT information Technology, and we were talking about this project management methodology. What we found is that immediately some of the people in the room, more than 20 people coming from the different division of the organization that manage projects. One of them said, Yeah, but just remember that our culture here is a culture in which our projects needs to be always on time. Doesn't matter how much they cost and doesn't matter if we have issues of quality. Immediately. This was a red flag, us coming from academia. Say, how come something like this is happening? And then there is a more senior person in the room that says, Well, let me tell you a story how this thing actually happened and how it trickled down through the organization and became a very strong culture of how we actually approach projects or how we look or what we look in projects in this organization.

So what she said was. That when Walt Disney World was opening. Walt Disney himself was in in the in the area of of Walt Disney World. The days before, just to found out that the lawn that surrounded the contemporary resort was not ready for the opening. So the day the inauguration was coming and he found that he was not going to meet the deadline. So what he did was something bold. He went and bought pretty much all the grass that he could get from anywhere in Florida. And if I'm not mistaken, the story goes into Georgia and Alabama. So and literally the day before the inauguration, there were lines of trucks with the grass ready to be laid down in the in the field, around the gardens, around the contemporary resort. But he found himself short of people that can actually do the work. So he began to put ads asking for volunteers on the local TV and radio. And at night, a lot of people show up and they were actually laying down all the grass in in the field. So, of course, the story here goes that he was walking across the lawn screaming with a megaphone. Green side up, green side up.

Next day. Of course, the the loan was done. But the question was, how much did he pay to that loan to get done and what was the quality of the loan after it was done? Because, again, these are people, normal people that you and me that were doing something that you are not trained to do. But in the end, everything looks green. And I assume, of course, I wasn't there. But that particular event. Trickle down to directors and managers and the people in Disney that what is most important is that we deliver on time. It doesn't matter if we need to go to release number two and release number three to debug the system. And it doesn't matter how much it's going to cost us because again, we are Disney and we have money. And again, this is what I heard from the people in that room saying that day. That particular topic was discussed later when the project was over and we were presenting the results to. Very high level people within a Walt Disney Corporation and someone asks, How come we are doing that? And someone told the story. And then this person said, Well, we need to change that. And I don't know what happened because again, that was our last day in that organization working as a consultant. But it was clear that the directors and the top management and leaders of Walt Disney World Corporation wanted to change the way things actually happened there.

So again, the importance of how the leaders, the CEO of organization, influence the culture of an organization and how that culture may influence the performance and capabilities and satisfaction of people working in the project. There are also two important cases that you need to take a look at that are providing your course pack. And one is the railroad system that goes in Northern Virginia. And what is important there is to recognize the cultural issues that are going on in that project. And the other important one is the one the that I told you that is important to look at, that the culture that goes into the country and how it's important to be recognized by you. And another one very important to look at is how the Russia pipeline influence the how the Russian pipeline project actually gets to be approved and what are the culture that goes there. All these things we're going to be covering in the next learning modules more in depth. But I just want you to look in there and look at certain clues, cultural clues to give you more idea of what a cultural standpoint is. And again, the analysis of of organizational culture and the analysis of what's going on and how that affects the project from a cultural perspective. With this, I'm completely in module number seven and I will be talking to you in module number eight.",7343,"[-0.01768745 -0.01810732  0.01653278 ...  0.00255044 -0.00189438

Introduction to Scheduling and Budgeting,9.0,PM,"Title: Introduction to Scheduling and Budgeting; Description: Module nine is an introduction to network scheduling in project management. The phases of network scheduling are explained, starting with activity definition, sequencing, estimation, project scheduling, scheduling control, and compressing the schedule. Activity definition involves brainstorming and making changes to the work breakdown structure to create a list of activities needed to complete the project. Activity sequencing involves determining the order in which activities should occur, considering natural interdependencies and using graphical tools like Microsoft Visio or a whiteboard with Post-it notes. Estimation of activity duration can be done through top-down or bottom-up approaches, using methods like level of effort, standard time, historical relationships, or the Simpson's rule. Project scheduling involves creating milestone charts and Gantt charts to visualize the sequence and duration of activities, while the PERT and PDM methods provide techniques for analyzing project networks and critical paths. The module concludes by emphasizing the importance of accuracy and data collection in estimation and scheduling processes.; Transcript: Hi and welcome to module number nine. We are going to go through the introduction to network scheduling and which is a very important part of project management. We're now talking about how we will manage time based on the statement of work and objectives and requirements set by the customer. So. Topics that we're going to cover include phases of network scheduling and project networks. We are looking to understand each of the phases of network scheduling, starting with activity definition. Activity. Sequencing. Estimation. Project Scheduling. Scheduling Control. And we're going to look at all these phases through the next learning modules. This one is the introduction to network scheduling. So let's look now into the phases of a network scheduling. The first thing that we do in network scheduling is. To define the activities that one needs to do. And second thing is that to understand what activity goes first in time and which one goes last pretty much is to define successors and predecessors. Then we define the duration of the activities. And fourth step is that we build the network in which we understand how these activities are going to be taking place throughout time. And how long it will take the project to go through all these activities. And the critical path or the identification of those activities that are more critical in terms of time. And finally, how we will control the schedule and how we compress the schedule, how we can actually be sure that the things are being.

Dawn on time. So let's talk now about activity definition. How would you find activities? Well, remember that we have the work breakdown structure and using the lowest level of your work breakdown structure, we get to defining activities. So on top of activities, the level is the work package that includes several different activities to complete as a work package or a small element of work within your project. So at this point, what we do is to brainstorm what are the things that needs to be done in order to accomplish or generate that small element or work package within your work breakdown structure? Because this is a brainstorming session, most likely we may need to make some changes in the work breakdown structure that we already have. So that is okay because we can go back and refine and or update the work breakdown structure. And at this point what we will have is a list of activities that needs to take place in our project. The next step is to determine the sequence in which these activities are going to happen. So as I said before, we need to understand which one goes first in terms of time, which one is the predecessors and which ones are the successors. So there are some natural interdependencies across activities. For example, you cannot build walls if you don't have the floor done and you cannot build the ceiling if you don't have the columns and the walls done and and the floor done.

So there are some clear natural predecessors in our task and we need to identify those by having a conversation in the team on what needs to go first and what needs to happen in order to the following activity. Has everything, all the inputs ready and and continue to move forward. So there are different approaches. We can look back and see how in the past we have done similar analysis and how different projects have actually identified the relationship across similar activities, or we can actually go step by step. And looking at each task and ask the question, what needs to happen before this task and what needs to happen after this task? And then began to set up the lines that the precedence between these two activities in in a in a graphical way. That's how I recommend to be done because you can actually see it in in graphical and have a better understanding of what goes before and after, probably the best way of doing it. If it is a small project, it's using any of the technology that we have available, maybe Microsoft Visio or maybe Microsoft, PowerPoint or any drawing tool so that you can move elements. Or activities and a left to right or up and down. And also, if it is a large project with many activities, a whiteboard with the Post-it notes can be a really good way of doing it, in which you move the Post-its, which are activities depending on when they are going to be happening.

And then you identify which ones go first, which ones can go in parallel and which ones needs to be last. This approach mean determine the sequence of activities? It is very time demanding When you have complex projects in which you have a lot of interrelationships. So you will need the help of software when you put all these things together. The next phase is the the estimation of the duration of the activities. And at this point we already know what are the activities and we already know what's the sequence of these activities. So we need to come up with another important phase, which is how long are they going to take? And usually this is a very fuzzy step because we do not know for sure at this point. We are pretty much trying to predict the future. But we can do it in a good way. And there are different approaches. The top down and bottom up in which we use similar methods to try to come up with the. Best estimate of how long it will take a given activity. The top down estimating goes into estimating big blocks of your work breakdown structure. Maybe at level two or level three, and it helps you to very quickly have a good understanding on how long it will take, however. It is very inaccurate because you are estimating at a very high level and you have not a clue of what is going to go in the low levels and granular level at the activity level.

So you may be either overestimating a lot or underestimating a lot. And the other thing is that even though it is very inaccurate, it may also give you the opportunity to have flexibility. If you was if you estimate a overestimate excuse me, and meaning that if you are in a project with a lot of uncertainty, maybe top down estimating will be a good thing if you inflate the estimates so that you have room to accommodate any uncertain item that can push the project back in terms of time. The other one is the bottom up estimating that goes to the lowest level, the activity level, and then begins to build up. And this one is more time consuming because you really need to go to the granular level and begin to build up to the level that you would like to work on. Uh, but it creates a good confidence that what you are doing really took into consideration every single activity or every single low level that had to be that had to take place in in the project. One. Another weakness besides that, it's time consuming is that this particular approach may be worthless. In other words, you may begin to determine how long it will take activities at the very low level that turn out to be not necessary to be taken in the project.

And in other words, what I'm saying is that you are trying to predict the future and you are trying to determine some activities that need to take place. However, if something changes in the project, everything that you have done with respect to those activities, including estimating, is just useless. You pretty much waste your time and the time of the project and if you generated some documents. Those documents can be easily borne out because you don't need them anymore. So let's go through the different methods that we can use in these two different types of approaches. The first method is the level of effort in this method. Where we're trying to find out is how long we will need to have a certain group of people in order to accomplish a given activity based on the capabilities of the project and the classification of the people. So in other words, it is like saying, well, in order to do this piece of the software, I will need three programmers for ten days and or like for example, if you're going to build a deck in your backyard, you'll say, Well, if you give me 2 or 3 carpenters, I'll be able to do the whole structure in a in a day. So this is how a level of effort works. The problem is that the you are focusing on people, not totally on the task.

And because people may be may have some variability in terms of of capabilities and there is a lot of uncertainty and therefore it may be very inaccurate. However, it gives you a very quick ballpark number that can be used to trigger more discussions. The older method is the standard time. The standard time is a method in which you relate the duration of an activity with the number of people and a type of of setting that you have in your project. So for example, for five engineers, software engineers, you can develop this with excuse me, with, with five software engineers, you are going to be able to develop 1000 lines of programming in, in, let's say in a very stable type of of programming or software development project. However, when we say this type of things, we are not accounting for the variance that this type of operations will have all over and over again. In other words, standard time, it is a. Radio that has been developed based on historical information on past data. So first of all, you are assuming that you have that data. And second of all, you are assuming that that data is current. And third of all, your project may be completely different from that standard time excuse me, from that standard data. And therefore you are incurring in some major variances by using it. So in other words, you cannot mimic your reality very well.

So weaknesses again, assume standard activities and assume historical record strength. If your activity is very similar to the activities that have been used to develop the standard, then you have a good accuracy on the estimation. The other one is historical relationships in which there is a clear ratio between a given variable of your project and the time. It is different from a standard time because the standard time focus on people and time and task. In this one, we are focusing on many other different variables. For example, a ratio that is used in Boeing in building aircraft is, for example, the the linear feet of of wind versus time building that that win. So depending on the length of a wind, they are able to determine how long and determine some other resources that are needed in building a certain wind. So it doesn't focus on people. It focuses more on other type of variables. And for example, I have an example on a screen right now that shows that gradient when we great here in, in academia. It depends on many variables, not only on people. For example, it depends on the number of questions that the exam has had, the number of people or students that I had taken the exam and maybe the number of Tas that has been helping me or that will help me to grade this quiz or this exam. And there may be some other things that are important to consider here.

And I just wanted to also tell you the story that I was working in a project in which we really wanted to develop a historical relationship. We were working in this house manufacturing project in which. The idea was to generate houses that were more affordable for the US community and that were more profitable for the manufacturer and that were more energy efficient for the government. And during that project we found that. Some of the manufacturers really didn't know how much a house actually cost before they actually give a price to the customer. In other words, a customer approach this this company or some of these companies working on this project. And they had to give her a price. And because each of these houses were custom made, they really didn't have a good robust way to calculate how much it was going to cost. In the end, of course, they ended up making money, but the houses were a little bit pricey. And not everybody was able to afford these type of houses. So they were looking to see how they can actually know how much it cost so that they can actually lower some prices and make them more affordable. So what we did was we really wanted to know how much a linear foot of wall internal wall cost to this company. And we had to look at several houses and took measurements.

And not only of how long it took to build a certain portion of the house in terms of linear foot of wall, but also if the that wall that people work on had certain number of sockets, had certain number of switches at windows, doors and anything that you can imagine, because all those variables influenced that time that we were going to calculate in the end after. A good three months of data collection and a lot of statistics. We found that our data didn't conclude with statistical significance, so we weren't able to use that and to find that relationship. So this type of parametric cost estimation, that is how it's called in academia. It is very powerful if you have enough data and enough statistical power to really call a relationship as being valid. Then there is this other rule that is very well explained in the book is the Simpson's rule, and it's based on the beta distribution. And the beta distribution comes out of the assumption that when people estimate the duration of tasks, sometimes we overestimate that. So that's how it has some beta or very skewed shape and. He comes again out of a statistics and and I like a lot this rule and this rule. Is the one that I'm expecting that you will use in your course project. And we will talk about the course project later on. And for for the use of this rule, you need to come up with three important values.

One is. The optimistic time or the minimum time that an activity can take. The most likely time or ML and that an activity can take and the pessimistic time or the worst time in which an activity can be completed. And there is an equation that is shown on the screen that optimistic plus four times most likely plus pessimistic divided by six and the six is a constant. It will give you the estimated time. Remember, at this point, we are just talking about estimate estimation. So if we have garbage in, we will get garbage out. So in order to estimate these numbers, you will need to go through a data collection and analysis process in which you will bring subject matter experts or you look back into historical information and try to determine similar activities, how long it will take or ask the subject matter expert How long do you think that each of these activities will take in terms of minimum, most likely and pessimistic times? So on. After that, we have already identified activities, the sequence, we have estimated the duration of the activity. So we need to move now into building a network that will help us to really find out how long it will take to complete a given project and and also to understand what are the. Critical path of that project if there is more than one, which is possible. And what are the critical activities, The one that we need to look at.

And because if one day or one unit of time delay in one of those activities, it will immediately delay the whole project. So let's talk about project scheduling. So. So far we have talked about the work breakdown structure and identify the activities and the duration. But none of these things help us to really understand and picture the whole sequence of how things are going to happen. We are not able to understand the real relationship across activities until we have everything completed in a network. From that start with the first activity and end with the last activity that happened in a project. So this thing will take a good amount of time if it is a large project. So it is recommended to use a software, but if it is a small project, I recommend you to do it by hand. And in terms of the course project that you need to do, you will need to build a project schedule. And I recommend that if you really know how to use Microsoft Project, then to use it to do the the part. But if not, I recommend you to do it by hand because you really understand the concept behind Microsoft Project. To those that have had a lot of experience using Microsoft Project, I also recommend doing it by hand because you will learn how to double check that the outputs of Microsoft projects are right.

And.

So what are the common approaches in project scheduling? So we talk about milestone charts in which the major pieces of of work that had to be completed in your project that we define as milestones are actually put it in a log in terms of when they actually need to happen and can be a simple table with deadlines for each of the milestones, or it can be included in your Gantt chart as we will see it in the next slide. Then we have the Gantt chart and we have the critical Path methodology and the Pert program evaluation and review technique and the PDM, the presence diagramming method. And there might be some other methods to use network analysis or time management in projects, but these are the ones that are usually most used in the project environment. In terms of Gantt charts. It has been widely known for many years and it has been widely used in different environments, but it is a really good presentation tool that shows horizontal bars, that goes from the start of the activity to the end of the activity and help us to understand how long they will take and and and if they have some type of clear precedence between the activities. So what I'm showing on the screen right now is a simple one, and we don't see much of the presence between them, but we see that. Uh, how long they will take. And on the left, we saw a start time and finish time. And we can change the scale of time that we have on top and we can expand or reduce that scale.

And then, of course, the chart will be wider or more narrow. The milestone chart, as I said, helps you, help you to really understand if you have achieved or met a major milestone. And then you check that box and you keep track of the milestone that you have made at at what point of time and when were they supposed to be completed. So because these are milestones, these are high level in your work breakdown structure, usually these are a level two or level three, but it depends on the project and depends on the environment that the project is being implemented. So the milestone, as I said before, the word said all is milestone is a way to measure the miles in your road and and therefore it helps you to measure progress as you go through that road. So in the project environment, we define them as major pieces of work that has been completed going back to, let's say, using the example of an airplane, we're talking about when your cockpit is completely done, when your fuselage is done, when the engines, engines are started, when you have the whole interior of the airplane completely done. So these are major milestones in a construction of a airplane. So what I'm showing right now is more sophisticated Gantt chart that shows relationships with the lines, as you can see, but also shows in text the resources that have been assigned to those activities.

In the diamonds. We see the. Milestones. So Microsoft projects help you to add milestones in your Gantt chart. And and they are represented by Diamonds and the black line. A horizontal. Lines represent a group of activities that we can compress and high level activities. Excuse me, high level pieces of work in your work breakdown structure. And if you look to the left, we see that we have work breakdown structure. In the second column that helps us to understand what each of these elements are and. Microsoft Project will allow you to compress all those activities and leave only the big levels shown on the screen. And we can use that also as a milestone chart or a way to track the major. Completion of the major work that had to be done. So now let's talk about the project networks and and the basics of of building project networks. And we actually are going to build a project network in the next learning module. But there are some basics that we need to cover. There are two ways of representing a network. One is when we have the activity on the arrow and the other one is when we have the activity on the node. What do we mean here? I'm showing that the activity represented by a letter is happening within the node or within that square. An activity, A leads to activity B, which leads to activity C, Or we can also say that activity B precedes activity C and activity A precedes activity.

B we have on the screen different types of relationships, sequential relationships to leading to 1 or 1 leading to 2 or 2 precedes 1 or 1 precedes to its a successor of two and we have inter relationship which is when we have a good complex environment, when we have activities on the arrow. This is represented as we see on the screen now. But when we have on the nodes are events. So in order to move from event to event seven, we need to perform activity. A That's pretty much what we say here and we have the same type of scenario. We have three activities leading to one event On the left down side of the screen we have activity A, B, C leading to event number seven, and then activity D moving from an event number seven to event number nine. And this will be more clear when we cover the next module, the example of how to build a project network. So with this, I'm completing this module Number nine Introduction to Project Scheduling, covering the basics that we need to have in order to move into a more sophisticated analysis of how we manage time in projects. And so I will see you in module number ten to talk about the scheduling and of how we actually put together a pair chart. And then following that learning module, we will have how we can actually build a PDM or precedence diagramming chart using the present diagramming method.",4696,"[-9.60037578e-05 -2.53749155e-02 -9.74833034e-03 ... -1.54669955e-02

Network Scheduling Techniques,10.0,PM,"Title: Network Scheduling Techniques; Description: In this video module on Network Analysis, students will learn about important topics related to time management in projects. The module will cover Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) and the analysis of PERT charts. Students will learn how to build a PERT chart, determine the critical path and duration, and identify critical activities in a project network. The instructor emphasizes the importance of following certain rules, such as building the chart from left to right or top down for better flow and understanding of the timeline. Students also learn that an activity cannot begin until its predecessors are completed. Key concepts highlighted in the module include the use of arrows to indicate precedence and flow in terms of time, assigning unique IDs to each activity, and integrating the work breakdown structure into planning and resource allocation. It is noted that looping or cycling is not allowed in PERT, and unconditional statements are also not permitted. The instructor mentions different ways of notating PERT charts but emphasizes the need to include essential information such as earliest start and finish times, estimated durations, activity IDs, latest start and finish times, and slack. Comparison between PERT and Critical Path Method (CPM) is discussed, with PERT being described as probabilistic and CPM as deterministic. The video highlights that PERT assumes unlimited resources, which is not realistic, and the use of probabilities in determining paths and critical activities. Variance is introduced as a measure of uncertainty in activity durations, and the instructor explains how it helps in identifying the most critical path. The module concludes with an example of a PERT network for a software project, illustrating the flow of events and activities, as well as the estimation of optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic times for each activity. Overall, this video module in ENMA 604 provides students with a comprehensive understanding of PERT and its application in project management. It covers key topics such as PERT chart construction, critical path determination, activity sequencing, and probability analysis. This module equips students with valuable knowledge and tools to effectively manage projects and optimize their time management skills.; Transcript: Hello and welcome to module number ten Network Analysis. Pretty much time management in projects. So we are going to cover a very important topics that are very useful for project managers. We are going to talk about that topic called. Program evaluation and review technique, or widely known as a pert. Analysis of pert chart. We're going to build a port and we're going to determine the critical path and the duration and determine the critical activities of the project network. And we'll see how that is important. So before we begin, there are a few rules that we need to understand. The first one is that we need to build the port flowing from the left to right or in the worst case, top down. And this again met your rules. And on how we can create a chart that has a better flow and a flow that we can understand without going back and forth, up and down to really follow what is going on in terms of time. The other very important rule is that. An activity cannot begin until the predecessors has been completed. So I cannot start painting a wall if that wall is not completely done. And let's say the compound to seal the drywall hasn't been completely dried. So there are some. Clear predecessors before we can start another activity. And the other rule is that the arrow indicates indicates precedence and also indicates the flow in terms of time. And each activity needs to have a unique ID.

And remember, coming from the work breakdown structure, the ID needs to match your work breakdown structure lowest level so that we can actually plan for it from the financial point of view and also from the human resource point of view. How are we going to fit resources people into the activity and then track completion and expenditures and keep an eye on the accounts? Looping or cycling is not allowed in Pert, so we cannot go back and keep going in cycles. Unconditional statements are not allowed. So it is a. Very deterministic in terms of how we use information and the. Notation that we have on the screen is a what I like to use personally. And you see that there are different ways of expressing the same information. The book has a similar way of doing it and. Again, it's just a matter of a perception of what you would like, how you would like to see it. But in general, it needs to have all these pieces of information all together. We're talking about the earliest start of an activity. The estimated duration coming out of your Simpson's rule or coming out of any of the other estimation methods. And the early finish time. And then we have in the middle the activity ID and or we may even write what the activity is about in just a simple line. And then in the lower left hand side, we have the latest start of the activity, the slack that we're going to talk about in a few slides ahead and the latest finish of the activity.

And now when we draw an activity on Arrow, a part, we have on top the activity and then early start, early finish and on the lower we have the duration and late start and late finish. Again, it depends on the way the organization has set up a part and how they need to be notated. But I have seen many different ways, and this is one and the book shows another. Another one, the textbook that you have and and you will you may see that different textbooks will have, again, different ways of doing it. So let's talk about the part. What's the major difference between a pert and a CPM, a critical path methodology. But both develop critical paths that are important. One of the major reasons why we do Peraton recipients both assume unlimited resources draw into the activity so that they can actually take place, which is a big lie. And we will talk about this in the next learning modules. But Pert is a probabilistic and CPM is deterministic. So we are talking that we use probabilities in the in the determination of the paths of the pert. If you assume independence in the variance of any part on a part. We can then assume that the standard deviation of the duration. Of that path will be equal to the standard deviation of each of the activities that.

Belong to that path. In other words, what I'm saying is that. The variance of a critical path is equal to the variance of each of the activities that build that critical path. And. Why is this important? Well, because sometimes we have in projects several critical paths. And and we will need to determine which of these critical paths are or is the most critical. And. So to do that, we go and look at the variance of the critical path. And because the the variance is a good measure of the uncertainty that we have in the duration of that path, then we pick the path with the highest variance as the most critical path, because it's the one that is more likely that we'll have something unexpected to happen there. Pretty much what I'm saying is that when we use the Simpson's rule, we estimate the most likely the pessimistic and the optimistic. But when we don't know much about an activity. The difference between the optimistic and the pessimistic is big and is. And and when we really know how long an activity can take, usually that difference between the pessimistic and the optimistic is very narrow. So in terms of duration. So pretty much what we're saying here is that we are going to pick the path that is more critical when we have more than one critical path. We will pick the one that is more critical as the one that has a big difference between the optimistic and pessimistic times, which is pretty much the variability.

So the one that has more variability within the path and why? Because it's the one that is more likely. That will give us a result towards the pessimistic time. Remember that we are using estimated times here and but it can be it can it can fluctuate, it can go to the minimum or it can go to the pessimistic or it can go to the optimistic or pessimistic. So we would like to have a critical path that gives you a wider range of options or possibilities. So let's do an analysis of a part. Assuming that this software project has six different events to go through. Event number one is the project is initiated. Event number two is the software requirements have been set. An event Number two is preceded by an event number one. Event number three is the software is completed and is preceded by event number two, which is the software requirements have been set. Event number four is the hardware has been installed and is preceded by event number two, which is the software requirements have been set. An event. Number five is the system is up and running, which is preceded by both event number three and event number four. And event number six is handover to the customer, which is preceded by event number five. Additionally, we know that to move from event 1 to 2, which is to move from the initiation of the project to the software requirement setting, the programmers met with the client to determine the requirements to move from event two to event three, which is from the software requirements set to the software have been completed.

Of course, the programmers needs to develop the software to move from event two to event four, which is to move from the software requirements set to the hardware has been installed. We are going to procure and install the hardware. To move from event three to event five, which is to move from the completion of the software to the system is up and running. We need to do some. Testing of the software in that hardware. Then to move from event number four to event number five. Which is from hardware installed to the system, is up and running. We need to do also some testing of the hardware using the software that has been developed. And finally, to move from event number five to event number six. We move from the system up and running to the handover to the customer, which is we prepare the handover to the customer and the system by making sure that everything is working fine, what is called a pre customer review. So if we use activity on the arrow, this is how it will look like. Event number one. It is the project requirements set. Event number two is. Uh, event number one is the project has been initiated. Event number two is the requirement has been set and activity, that is, that the engineers met with the customer to define the requirements actually took place.

So same thing happened and you see how actually goes through the network. We began to understand the precedence and look at how each event has an event that precedes and how each activity has an activity that precedes. So clearly we see that activity is preceded by both by E and activity is preceded by B and activity is precede by C and activity B and C are preceded by activity A. So now we went to a group of subject matter experts and we use all the information that we have historical information on past projects, and we determine these three important pieces of information. What is the optimistic time for each of the activity? The most likely time for each of the activities and the pessimistic time so optimistic or minimum. So for example, in activity A, we said that it was going to take 17 days, most likely will be 29 pessimistic worst case scenario will be for 47 days. Then using the Simpsons rule, we have an estimate of 30 days that is optimistic plus four times most likely plus pessimistic divided by six, in which six is a constant. Okay. And then there is this other important piece of of information. There is an equation that goes with the Simpson's rule in which we can calculate the standard deviation of an activity using the pessimistic time and the optimistic time divided by six and six again is a constant.

So the pessimistic minus the optimistic for activity A is 47 -17 divided by six, and that is equal to five. So we calculate the estimated duration time using the Simpson's rule for each of the activities and also calculated the standard deviation of each of the activities so that we can actually. Determine the variance of each of the of the critical path. So we need to go through a step by step process to build a part. First thing is that we construct the network. And in which the activities will flow from left to right. And considering the presence of the activities and making sure that each activity has an ID and that we are using a format box or the notation of the pert. Then we need to start, estimate and determine the early start and early finish of the activities from left to right or what we call the forward pass. And assuming that we will start the first activity in time zero, which might be different or might not be that true, but we will talk about that in the example. Then we determine the late start and late finish of each activity flowing in the backward pass from the right to left and until we get to the first activity and then we determine the total project completion time, which is the earliest finish or late finish of the last activity of the network. Then we calculate the standard deviation of the project completion time and assuming independency in in the activities that define the critical path shown on the screen.

Then we determine this lack of activities by subtracting the late finish from the early finish or the late start from the early start. And finally, we can calculate the probability. Of completing the project at a given time or over a given time. It's important that we understand the concept of slack. And the slack is a, as I said before, is calculated mathematically by subtracting the early finish from the late finish or the early start from the late start. The result is the same. But the slack is, is that amount of time in which an activity is can be delayed without delaying the whole duration of the project. But let's see that in an example. We have. We need to stop here, and I need to get to the handout. Okay. So in your handout. We have detailed. Details of how this pert analysis can be done. So going to the data that we have in the problem and that we have on the slides, then we go and make sure that we use the notation. Again, you can use a different notation that has the same. Elements or same information. And here is how the. Chart will look like. So we have activity B and C precede by activity. A activity D precedes B, E precedes C and F is precede by D and by E.

As you see, I already included the estimated time of each of the activities. So 30 for activity, A 13 for B, 16 for D, 20 for C, six for E and five for F. So now we're going to complete the early starts and early finish in that forward pass from left to right. And then we'll do the complete the late finish and late start on a backward pass. And then we calculate the slack and calculate the standard deviation of the. Path. So. What we see here is that the first thing is that we are assuming that we are starting in time zero. This might not be true. Your project might be already ongoing and this is just an element of the whole project. So you may have here, let's say time 40, 50 weeks, but for us as project managers of that specific piece of work, it is good that we have time zero. So we have a better understanding on what's going on. But as I said, you have the option to have a different starting time. The answer would be pretty much the same. And so what we do is we calculate the late the early finish by adding the estimated time to the early start of the activity in this case is zero plus 30 is equal to 30. So now we move the 30. From being the early finish of activity as the early start and of activity. B and activity E So we move it from here, goes to be here and from here it goes to be here.

And that is the next step. So. By doing that. We. Already know the early start of activity and of activity. C So we add the estimated duration of each of the activities. We calculate the early finish of each of the activities in this case, activity D early finishes 43 and of activity. I see it's going to be 50. And then we do the same thing. We move 50. As early start of activity and 43 as early start of activity. And then we add up to each of the activities, 16 days of estimated time of activity times plus 43 is 59 and six days of estimated time of activity plus 50 is equal to 56. Now we have a decision point in which we need to decide what was going to be the earliest part of activity. If we have 59 on top and we have 56 on E, So remember that the rule in which we cannot start any activity until the predecessors have been completed. In other words, we cannot start activity f until both of these D and E has been completed. E is going to be completed faster than D is going to be completed early, finishing in day 56. Activity is going to be completed a little bit later, later, which is an activity in day 59. So we need to go with 59. Now we move 59 as the earliest start of activity F, which is when the activity F can start without violating the precedence.

So. If we move 59 and we add five estimated time, then the early finish of this project Net is going to be 64 days. And with this we complete the forward pass and we need to begin to complete the backward pass in which we are going to determine the late finish and the late start. The big assumption that we make here is that the. Late finish is always equal to the early finish of the last activity. So in this case it's activity F So we move 64 down to late finish and we subtract. Uh, five from or the estimated duration of F from the late finish of activity F and that gives us 59 as late start of activity. F And then we move activity F late start as late finish of the predecessors in this case activity. D So 59 and we will do the same thing on for activity. E And with that we get the information needed to calculate the. Late start of activity. D and D, which is subtracting at the estimated duration of the activity minus the late start. So 59 minus six is. 53 and 59 -16 is 43. So we continue. And here is we move the 53 as a late start of activity, as an early start of activity C and we move 43 of activity D as late, start as late finish of activity B and we subtract the estimated duration of activity B, which is 13 -43.

It will be excuse me, 43 -13, it will be 30 and 53 -20 will be 33. And now we have another decision point in which we have the late start of activity B and late start of activity C being different. And we need to move one value as late finish of activity A and as in our forward pass, we decide to use the longer time as the. The early start of activity in the backward pass, we need to choose the lower value or the less duration to keep that rule consistent. So in this case, we're going to pick activity B as the early start and that we're going to move the excuse me, the late start of activity B as the late finish of activity A in this case is 30. So 30 will move down and we have 30 -30 as estimated time. Then the. Late start of activity. A It's going to be equal to zero. So the other step that we take is the calculation of the slack. And the slack is either the late finish minus the early finish of an activity or the late start minus the early start of an activity. So in this in each case, the result is the same. So in activity F 64 -64 is equal to 0 or 59 -59 is equal to zero. And we do the same thing in each activity.

59 -59 is zero, 43 -43 is zero, 30 -30 is equal to zero. Here is 53. -50 is equal to three and 59 -56 is equal to three. The next step is that we need to calculate the or determine which one is the critical path. And the critical path is defined by two things. One. Is the path that will define how long the project is going to take. And the other thing is that it's the part that has the slack equal to zero in all the activities. In this case, we see activity A, B, D, and F has slack zero and is the path that will define the longest time that will take the project. So at this point, we already know that the project, this project is going to take 64 days and that it has a critical path equal to A, B, D, and F, and that we can calculate the. Uh, standard deviation of the path that or the estimated duration time that can help us to calculate the probability that we can meet a certain deadline set by the customer. Another important thing that we need to understand with respect to early start and early finish. Or late start and late finishes. What does what does that value mean? I mean. What does it mean that we have a late start or late finish? Early start or early finish? Pretty much what it says is that the early start of any activity is the time.

At which we can start that activity without delaying the duration of the project by any time unit. So I can start. I need to start activity A in time zero. Otherwise, any time value that pass a zero, it will immediately delay the whole duration of the project in the same unit. So for activity B, I need to start activity B as early as 30 days. And as late as in 30 days. And I need to finish activity, be as early as 43 days or as late as 43 days. So it doesn't give me much room. So that but if we go down in the lower path, we see that we can start activity, see. In as earlier as in 30 days or as late as in 33 days. Which gives you a slack. Of three days. Meaning that. We can delay the start of activity C by three days without affecting the whole duration of the project. This immediately means that we may have some resources assigned to activity C and E that can be used in activity B and D to speed up the process. And that's part of what we're going to cover in the next learning modules, because it means that we need to determine resources and and how we can actually allocate them in the best way to optimize the duration of the project. So we're going back to the presentation. Coming back from the handout. Now, the next thing that we need to do is to determine that probability that we can actually meet or exceed certain deadlines set by the customer.

So using now the normal distribution, we can determine that probability, the normal distribution use the expected value, which in this case is the 64 days that we have already determined and the variance that we need to calculate using the standard deviation that we determine for each of the activities, but now only to those activities in the critical path. And the notation is a normal distribution is approximately equal to the expected value and the standard deviation or variance. Excuse me. And so 64 days we already calculated as the estimated duration of the project. And so now let's calculate the variance of the project critical path. And remember what we talked about, the variance. We said that the variance of a critical path, assuming independency of across the activities is equal to the sum of those activities within the critical path. So remember that the critical path that we found was activity the A, B, D and F activity, A activity B activity D and F defines the duration of the project. And so. How do we calculate the variance of that critical path? So we look at the estimated time, the Simpson's rule equation and look at the calculation of the standard deviation for each of the activities, and then use that standard deviation as the input to calculate the variance of each of the activities and then of the whole critical path.

So in this case, what we're seeing here is that the sum of the variance of activity, A activity B activity D and activity F is equal to the standard deviation square, which is five squared plus three squared plus one squared plus one squared and is actually the square root of all that. It would be the. The standard deviation that we can use to calculate the probability. So let's look into the normal distribution representation. 100% probability is everything that we have within the curve and the expected value. In this case, 64 is in the middle and this one is standard deviation to the curve. And we will need to calculate the deadline set by the customer of day 70. So in other words. The customer is asking us what is the probability that the project cannot meet his or her or their deadline, which is being completed in 70 days? So to do that, we set up the normal distribution problem and in which the probability, the probability that the deadline is over 70 days is trying to be found. So we use the C equation in which the C value is equal to the deadline set by the customer, which is 70 minus the expected time of the project, which is 64 divided by the standard deviation of the critical path that we saw. That is the square root of 36, which is equal to six. And so that value is equal to 1.0. So 70 -64 divided by six is equal to one.

So a value of Z equal to one needs to be solved in the normal distribution tables in which we have the probabilities assigned to each of the Z values and that probability is equal to 0.8413 for the area at the left of the Corps. But that means that it will give us the probability that we meet the deadline of 70 days of the customer. But what we're looking is what will be the probability that we exceed that 70 days set by the customer, which is the opposite side of the normal distribution curve. So that we need to subtract 1.0 to 0.8413. And. So let's take a look at the tables so we understand how to calculate that probability using the tables. So on the screen, I have the normal distribution tables that you have in the handout and your course pack, excuse me. And we will see how we can actually calculate these probabilities based on the Z values. So the value that we got in the previous example is a Z value is 1.00. So we go to the first column and look at that value is 1.00. And then we look at the decimals. We have 0.00 decimals, which is the next column. And then you see how the value that we use was 0.8413. So let's assume another very random number here. Let's say that we have a Z value of 2.05. So how do we do that? So we look into the Z first column C table and we look for 2.05.

And.

On 2.05 will give me A00 as a decimal is 2.05. Actually, no. I'm looking for 2.50, which is not what I was saying. I was saying 2.05. So 2.05. I need to look into the column which I have values equal to zero five, which is this column, and then use the row of 2.0. So it will be a. .9798. Value of Z equal to 2.05. Okay. I hope that this gives you a quick demonstration of how to use the Z values, which is basic statistics. So let's go back to the presentation. So using that Z value as I show that Z value from the table gives us the probability of the left side of the distribution. This is the probability that we will meet the 70 days or equal to 0.84 or 84% probability that we will meet the 70 days deadline set by the customer. However, remember that the question was what is the probability that we did not meet that 70 days, which is the other part of the distribution. So what is the probability that we do not meet it? And for doing that, we will need to remember everything below the curve is 100% or 1.0.

So we will need to subtract the 0.8416 out of 1.0 and that will give us a value of a probability of not meeting the deadline set by the customer of 70 days equal to 0.16 or 16%. So with this, I'm covering the basics of how we build her charts. And we also understood how to identify the critical path of a network, how to identify the estimated duration time of a network, how to calculate the estimated duration time of each activity using the Simpson's rule. We also understood how to determine the probability that a given project will exceed or not a certain deadline set up by the customer using the C tables. So with this, we are moving now to the next learning module, which is going to be module 11, in which we will talk about a different type of chart that provides a different type of capability that is called the precedence diagramming chart or the PDM, which use a present diagramming method to represent it. However, it is very similar than the Pert chart and so I will see you in the next learning module.",6155,"[-0.00550696 -0.00734936 -0.01147283 ... -0.00991388 -0.01247164

Precedence Diagramming and Network Scheduling,11.0,PM,"Title: Precedence Diagramming and Network Scheduling; Description: Welcome to ENMA 604! In this video module, we will be focusing on the Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM) and its application in project management. The key topics that will be brought up repeatedly are the relationships and constraints between activities.
We will discuss the relationships between activities, including start-to-start, start-to-finish, finish-to-start, and finish-to-finish relationships. Each relationship involves a lag or delay between activities, which will be explored in detail. Real-life examples, such as money transfer time and contract durations, will be used to illustrate these concepts.
The module will also cover the concept of critical paths in project management, including its calculation and the significance of deviations. Examples of critical paths with expected durations and standard deviations will be given to help students understand these concepts.
The video module will guide students in building a more realistic PDM by considering relationships and constraints between activities. Topics such as early start, early finish, late start, and late finish for each activity will be discussed, and manual calculation methods will be demonstrated. However, it will be emphasized that using software for calculations is more efficient and accurate.
A case study will be presented, where the instructor assisted a student with a 20-activity project that took months to complete manually. This highlights the complexity and time-consuming nature of manually building and analyzing project networks with relationships and constraints.
Students will also be assigned a homework question that challenges them to calculate the probability of completing a project within a specified timeframe. This will allow students to practice using Z tables and calculating standard deviation.
Lastly, the video module will mention that the next module will cover compressing the schedule and considering resource constraints in project management, providing a glimpse into what students can expect in the next session.
By the end of this video module, students should have a comprehensive understanding of the PDM method, its application in project management, and the importance of considering relationships and constraints between activities. They will also have gained practical experience in calculating early start, early finish, late start, and late finish for activities in a project network.; Transcript: Okay. Hi. We're coming back to continue the network analysis topic and we're going to complete in this coming learning module. Module 11, the PDM method, which is the presence diagramming chart or presence diagramming method. And this is a very sophisticated chart. It has a different set of relationships. And we are going to have a small example of what it is and it is being included in this course as a way to expose you to what it is outside, but you are not expected to use it in your course project. So let's go into the presentation. So we're going to do the PDM and we're going to complete an example and we are going to understand the essence of PDM, which is goes into the different type of relationships that can actually exist in reality. And and I will pick your brain on this of each of these type of relationships. So the first thing that we need to understand is that this PDM method is used by the common network analysis software available on over the shelf outside the the most sophisticated one, of course, included as well. And we will see that the the difference from the pert and the CPM is that the the the PDM provides a more accurate or more realistic type of relationship between activities. We use the same notation of part. And as I said before, it can be this notation or it can be any other type of notation that includes the same information and.

Let's talk about the relationships. While we have different from the Perth and CPM to the PDM is that now we can define the type of relationship between activities. In the past, our relationship was that when one activity ends, immediately the following activity was going to start. So there is no delay between one activity and another activity. So now what we're going to introduce is that the concept of lag or a delay between one activity and the following activity set up by the relationship. Okay. So here are the different types of relationships that we're going to talk about. The start to start relationship in which we define a time between the start of one and the start of another one. The second one is start to finish, which we define a lag or a time that needs to pass between the start of one activity and the finish of another activity. And finish. Finish, we start a lag or time that needs to pass between the finish of one activity and the start of another activity. And the finish to finish, or which is the lag or the time that needs to pass between the finish of a given activity and each successor. Okay. So let's look at now a brief example. Activity B cannot start until activity A has been in progress for at least a certain time or. Activity B cannot start after a certain number of days has passed since the start of activity.

A In this case, what I'm showing is activity A has early start of zero estimated duration. Time is 20 and of course we add zero and 20 early finishes 20. But in reality I want you to pay attention is to. The lag that we have from the start of activity to the start of activity B, which has been defined by 15 days, so zero plus 15. Then the early start of activity B is 15 days plus five early finish of activity, B is equal to 20 days. So here is where I want to pick up your brain and I would like you to think about for the next few seconds, I would like you to pause the tape and think about what type of activities you have seen in projects that you have, that you have worked on, or any type of activity at work or at at home, or personal activity in which we define a clear relationship, a clear lag between the start of one activity and the start of another activity that is independent of the duration of the activity. Okay. So pause the tape for a few seconds and then think about that. And I'll give you an example. Okay. So. Quick example that happens pretty much every day from the start of activity to the start of activity. Let's say that activity A. Is a transfer. So from the. Time that I start to make a transfer of money to the time that I actually can spend a certain amount of money across bank, let's say overseas.

Certain amount of days needs to happen. So even though, again, as I said, I started the transfer in day one, in reality, I can spend that money in another bank after a certain time has passed, usually 7 to 10 business days. So that's an activity. So spending the money. So that's a good example that I wanted to bring here. So the next relationship is start to finish or what is called that. Between the start of activity A and the finish of activity B certain amount of time is to happen. What you have on the screen is that 50 days of lag needs to be placed between these two activities. So going back to the same notation, I have activity a as estimated duration time of 20 days starting in time zero. So early finish of activity A is 20 days. But now let's look at the relationship from the start of activity A to the finish of activity. B 50 days needs to happen. So 50 days plus zero. That means that activity B is expected to finish early or have an early finish time of 50 days minus the early duration excuse me, the estimated duration of 30 days. That means that the early start of activity B is equal to 20 days. So again, I would like to pick your brain here and I would like you to think about what type of activities we have nowadays that can be defined by this type of start to finish relationship.

So pause and think about that for a few seconds and then continue. Okay. So I hope that you came up with some ideas. So I'll give you one example. When you begin to work in as a consultant, as a companies or are doing projects, usually you have certain type of contracts that will restrict the amount of time that you can work. The amount of time that you can, let's say, be in a certain facility. And and usually that is given by a start to finish relationship from, in other words, from the start of a given contract to the finish of the last activity within that contract, certain amount of time is to happen. So in other words, you are not supposed to work over the duration of that contract because you'll be violating some of the terms of the contract and or some of the rules that has been set, or you might be violating a work permit that has been given to you for a certain period of time. That includes from when the the work needs to start and from where that work needs to actually finish. So even though we see this as two sequential activities, this might be a might be the start of the first activity of a network in a project and B may be the last activity of that network or that project.

So going to the next one, the finish to start relationship in which a given activity cannot start after certain days have passed between the end of the previous activity. This is kind of similar to the ones that we have seen before in the past, but with the difference that now each of these activities will have certain days or a lag in between them. So in this example, as I see going again, using the same information that we have before, so it's 20 days estimated time, earliest start is zero, so early finish is 20. So instead of moving 20 as early finish of activity B, there is a lag of ten days. So we need to add 20 plus ten so it's equal to 30 days of early start of activity B plus ten as earliest estimated time of activity B is equal to early finish. Of activity be of being 40. So 30 plus ten is equal to 40. So this is more easy to come up with an example. And so I'll leave you a few seconds to think about an example that has this type of relationship between two activities of finish to start. So please pause the tape and think about a given relationship between two activities that you have come across or that you can imagine between in a in reality.

So. Few seconds and then I'll give you an example. Okay. So now a very well known example. Every time that you look into in any textbook is the concrete example. So if we pour concrete on any structure, we need to wait until that concrete has been cured. And if our estimated time doesn't include the curation of that concrete, then we need to add it as a lag in between activities. So between we pour the concrete and we actually start building another structure on top of that concrete. Certain amount of time needs to happen and that's a clear finish to start relationship. Finally, we have the other type of relationship finish to finish in which a certain amount of time is to happen between the finish of one activity and the finish of another activity. And usually we see this in different work environments. And for example, here what I'm showing is that the same thing activity a of of early start equal to zero, early finish equal to 20 an estimated duration of 20. But now we see that the lag between the finish of A and finish of B is equal to 40 days. So we add 40 days plus the early finish of activity, a 20 and that gives us the 60 of early finish of activity. B then we subtract the estimated duration of 30 to 60 and then the estimated start time of activity, estimated early start time of activity B is equal to 30.

So now again, picking your brain. I would like you to think about something that has these two type of activities in this related in this way. Finish to finish relationship. So a few seconds for you to think about and then I'll give you an example. Okay. So now a good example that happens in different environments. For example, in the. Uh, software development industry or in the pharmaceutical industry. Is the concept of testing before you actually release a new medicine or release a new version of your software or program. So if a, let's say, is programming or doing your your development and B and A is doing that and B is testing, then certain amount of time needs to happen between the finish of your development and the actually completion of your testing and releasing of the product or or drug. So in this case, we can see that the test certain amount of time needs to pass from the end of a and the end of the testing product. Usually we have this type of relationship in in drugs as a year in which several tasks are going to happen and several. Uh, experiments in real subjects needs to happen before it's released to the public in the project environment, in the software development industry, this is where you run different models or different simulations to test that your software is actually doing what it was supposed to to do when you were programming.

So now in the next slide, I have an example that builds upon the previous example that we had. Remember in the previous module that we have a network that has expected duration of 64 days with the critical path of A, B, D and F. We have a standard deviation of the critical path equal to six days and a probability of completing the project after 70 days equal to 16% or completing the project before 70 days equal to 84%. So based on that. The project manager was approached by a lead engineer suggesting that we need to consider some other things that we didn't consider in that example. Now we have a different set of relationships across all the activities, and now we need to build a more realistic, paired or PDM that accounts for these constraints set up by the relationships. So at least 35 days from the start of activity to the start of be at least 30 days from the start of B to the end of D and at least 60 days from the end of of. Uh, activity eight to the start of F and at least eight days from the end of activity C to the end of activity. So it's the same. Set, but here is how things actually look with this type of relationship. Immediately we see that it's going to take longer. It's going to go from 64 days to 95 days.

And we see how the relationship between A and B start to start. We have a lag of 35 days. So from zero plus 35, that defines the 35 that we have here. Immediately we see how the relationship between B and D has a start to finish and 35 and a lag of 30 means that this is going to finish in day 65. So 65 -15 is equal to 50 as early start and and going back to B 35 plus 13 as estimated time is early finish equal to 48 months. And if we go down, we see that there is a finish to start relationship between activity A and activity F, So we know that early finish of activity A is equal to 33 plus zero. And then 30 plus 60 days of lag is equal to 90. So 90 is the early start of activity F and plus five of estimated duration. Then the estimated duration of the project is 95 days. However, however, we have another relationship between activity C and activity E. We don't have a clear relationship between A and C, so we assume that there is zero between activity A and and C, So 30 earliest finish of activity, a pass as early start of activity C and then 20 as estimated duration of C plus 30 is equal to 50 as early finish of activity C and then we have a finish to finish relationship between C and E and then 50 plus a lag of eight days is equal to 50 A and 58 minus seven is equal to 51 as early duration.

So with that, we complete the late finish of 95 moving down and then 90 here we move 90 as early finish, a late finish of of each activity and then complete the backward pass in all the network. So as you see, it's a it's very much. The same network, but extremely more complex in terms of analysis. If you use a software, it will do all the calculations for you, of course. And so I recommend that if you have a project that has this type of relationship, do not try to do this thing by hand. This is just. Six different activities that we have on the screen. And you saw the complexity of trying to build all this project by hand. And I had students a few years ago that tried to do a project of 20. Activities by hand. And it literally took us about a couple of months of going through all these things together. I mean, he actually did the work and went to my office and I had to revise it and review it and make some revisions. And we went back and forth for a month, pretty much every day, meeting for a few minutes to try to help him do this by hand, which is totally useless. So I just wanted to demonstrate this very powerful method so that you understand that there are some other very powerful tools outside if they actually are needed by the project that you are going to be working on.

So quick question for you. What would be the probability that we can complete this last project under 60 days? So this is a homework for you to look at the how to use the Z tables and how to calculate the standard deviation of the critical path and all that and if there is any critical path. So look at that question and you don't need to go back to the instructor with the answer is just for you to practice. So with this, I am completing this module 11th. And as I said before, it was just more of a representation demonstration of what the PDM actually can do. And we will continue with module 12 and and continue to get into more the technical side of project management and how we can actually work on compressing the schedule and making sure that we account the resource side of the project into the schedule, which up to now we have assumed that we have unlimited resources, meaning that we can add any resource that is needed to any activity to. Uh, to be accomplished, which is a big lie. So we will do that reality check in the next learning module. So thank you very much and I'll see you in module number 12.",3811,"[-0.00420253 -0.01126949 -0.00536579 ... -0.00506657 -0.01553254

Managing Project Budgets,13.0,PM,"Title: Managing Project Budgets; Description: Module 13, titled ""Managing Project Budgets,"" focuses on the cost management aspect of project management. This module is essential as it delves into the details of how project money is spent and managed. It covers topics such as project cost, project budgeting, and the various issues that arise in budgeting. The module emphasizes the importance of understanding direct costs, which include expenses that directly contribute value to the project, such as labor, materials, contractors, and equipment.
Indirect costs, on the other hand, refer to overhead expenses like administration, employee benefits, and other miscellaneous costs that are not directly linked to the project but are crucial for its success. The module explains how companies determine the percentage of indirect costs to add to the direct costs to calculate the total cost of the project. It also highlights the challenges and uncertainties associated with estimating and managing project costs effectively.
The module then delves into project budgeting, describing it as the financial aspect of project management that involves planning, controlling, and measuring project costs. Budgets serve as a baseline for assessing cost performance and are usually approved by senior management or relevant stakeholders. Budgets also allow for comparisons across different projects, irrespective of their size, and lay the foundation for financial forecasting and contingency planning.
Furthermore, the module introduces the concept of a time-phased project budget, which accounts for the cash flow and expenses across the project's lifecycle. This detailed budgeting approach provides a clear understanding of resource requirements and cash flow patterns. Lastly, the module emphasizes the importance of adapting the budget to changing circumstances and accounting for uncertainty and potential changes in the future. It encourages project managers to include provisions for unexpected events and factors like economic fluctuations and salary increases in their budgets.
Overall, this module equips students with the knowledge and skills needed to effectively manage project budgets and ensure financial success.; Transcript: Hello and welcome to module 13 Managing Project Budgets or the cost management side of project management. So these are very important learning module because again is about the money side after the project has been kicked off and and approved. So we decided to really look at the nuts and bolts of of how we were going to spend our money and, and sometimes we build budgets beforehand on a very general level just to give a feedback to the source or the customer, how much we probably expect that the project is going to take. Sometimes we actually go very deep and to try to manage our cost and that's part of what we're going to cover today. And so looking at the slides. Topics are the project cost. Um, an example of a project budgeting and we'll talk about some issues in project budgeting. And so we understand major items that we need to consider when we do a budget. And what are the major issues of doing budgeting now? What is a time phase project budget? So first, let's cover some basics. And again, here is where you will need to. Have some basic levels of financial analysis or cost analysis that are covered in our engineering management program. But I will cover those in a very general level. So the first one is that we need to understand. What are direct costs and also what are indirect costs and a total cost. We define that direct plus indirect cost.

Direct cost is usually anything that adds value and has indirect impact on the service and products that we are going to generate. We talk about being those direct labor or some type of raw materials or direct materials that contractors that we're bringing to help us in building the products or delivering the service and any equipment that we need to rent or facilities that we need to rent are important. This, again, are some of the most common ones. But you may find out that your project will have a different type of direct cost. So this list do not include everything. So then in terms of indirect costs, we're talking about the overhead. And the overhead includes administrative costs, benefits of the employees and many other things. And. The direct costs are usually very clear because are any of the things that we need to buy or we need to pay so that we can actually deliver the service of the product required by the customer. But the indirect costs are more fuzzy, and here's where we need to rely on the administration or accounting side of our organization. So that they provide us with that that number that is needed for us to put our total cost of the project together. Usually this percentage, this number comes out of a percentage that we add to the direct cost and. Just to keep in mind how this number is crunched or is calculated.

We need to look at in a company how we are going to be paying for. Cost that our project is going to incur that are not clearly directly related to the product or services that we're going to achieve. For example. When we. Do projects we need to pay. Our people, our team. We need to pay our contractors and usually we have a function within the administration of the company in accounting that is the one that takes care of the accounts that we need to pay. And now that take cares of the employees and that funneled the money through them, through their banks or through checks. So this is an example of a group of people that are not totally related to the project, but that we cannot live without them. So we need them to support the project. So the question is how much are we going to charge our project based on what they do? And there are different ways in which companies actually come up with this number. And for example, in the company that I used to work on, they build projections of what are the projects that are coming next year, and they say we have ten, 20 different projects and then they divide the total cost of operations. From the administrative point of view. For example, how much is going to cost us to have a human resource management function, which means the facilities, the licenses that they may have in the software and the people that the clerks that will do all the crunching numbers and help to pay the personnel.

And so we put all those costs, the general manager, the building that we are renting, a power, electricity of the whole building. So all those costs come together and that gives you a sum of the total operation cost not related to the projects. And then they come up with the, the number of projects that you are projecting that you will do next year. And then you divide based on the size of the project. You divide how much you will charge the projects in terms of. Amount of of money. Usually if if that is not that clear in terms of how much it would be, how many projects you will do next year. Then they come up with a percentage. They say, well, if we project this amount of projects, the worst case scenario is if we charge each project 20% or 30% of the direct cost. If we project all that, we will be covering the operations cost that we have in this organization. So right now here at ODU, we have different rates that we charge our project sponsors. And for example, if the project is going to be completed outside the school, meaning that we are not going to use any of the school facilities or the university facilities, we usually charge between 24% and 30% of indirect costs over your direct cost.

If the project is going to be completed in the school using the lab laboratories and the facilities that other facilities that we have, then the cost can go up up to 50%. So meaning that the direct costs of the project are $100,000, that the total cost of the project are going to be $150,000 because it's the 50% that we need to add. So again, this is a very high level explanation of direct costs and indirect cost. I was in charge of doing auditing of the total cost of the manufacturing plant that I was working on. And he's not that easy. It's something that takes a humongous amount of time and sometimes it depends on the billing cycle. So in other words, sometimes you would like to close today the cost of a company, but you haven't received the power bill or the gas bill. And then you need to estimate and that's where things really begin to be fuzzy. So let's talk now about the project budgeting and how we build the budget. So there are several things that we need to understand. First is that the budget is the money side of the project is how we manage and plan and control the cost of a project. So hopefully specify the expenditures that you're going to have in the project in the future, hopefully, because again, this is totally estimation and we don't know what things we need to put money on so that the project achieve its goal and meet the requirements set by the customer.

But one thing is for sure, the budget will help us to have that financial baseline from which we are going to measure the cost performance of the project. We usually don't change that baseline. In other words, the project may be receiving an increase in the budget and as requested by the customer because the customer requires an addition of some requirements that were not in the original contract. That is a good reason why we would like to change that financial baseline. However, we always need to have that original one so that we can compare when it has been a change in the baseline and then compare that with the actual performance from the cost point of view. The budget is usually approved by the senior management of an organization. However, there are different levels when you have a large capital project, usually goes can be up to the owners of the organization, the shareholders, shareholders in the in the government environment. It can go up to the Congress. So. But when you have small projects that depend depends on the organizations, let's say lower than $10,000, then there is no need of major approvals just going through 1 or 2 check and 1 or 2 signatures, and that will be okay to get the funds and move on.

Uh. The another thing that a budget gives us is the ability to compare across different projects. So in other words, we see sometimes that we have a project managers managing very large capital projects and some other managers managing very small ones. So for example, I have a good friend of mine that is working now in a project based organization, and the other day we were talking and I asked him, How many projects are you managing now? And say, well, from the ten projects that I used to manage every month a few years ago, now I'm up to almost 60 projects managing in a given day. So my question was on how much in terms of total budget are we talking about? And he said, well, in the past we were talking about few thousand dollars. Now we're talking about millions of dollars that I'm managing every month. And I say, okay. And in terms of the size of this project, he said, well, believe me or not, the large projects, the one that has in hundreds of $1,000 range, those are the ones that less problem actually give me. The small ones with the small budgets are the ones that really doesn't make any sense for us to do. Why? Because we do not generate much profit out of them. It generates a lot of trouble and there are many of those that I need to worry about.

And so, again, the point here is that we need to understand that. The size of the project may be measured by the amount of money that they have, but not necessarily would measure the profits that you will get and how easy they might be or not to manage them. So another student the other day told me that he is managing one of the largest projects in the history of the US and. However, that it is a very expensive against a large capital project. But this project has very few people, very few contractors. In other words, it has a very large budget, but very limited stakeholders and limited complexity. So it's a very easy to manage project from that point of view. The only thing that is important to recognize in the budget is that we need to make sure that we have some factor that accounts for unexpected or for uncertainty in the environment. Right now we know that the economy has been going well in the last months, but we don't know what's going to happen in the next year. So we may have to increase the budget in the next year just in case something bad happens. Another thing that we need to be sure that we include there is that in this multi-million multi-year project is that everybody probably will get a raise. And then you need to add an escalation factor that will account for the new salaries and new benefits that some of the people working under your project will have.

So this doesn't mean, again, the discussion point here is that the budget it needs to change depending on the environment and depending on the requirements that may be set in the future. So. Again, if we know that they're going to be large changes in the organization, that may also change the indirect costs. And we need to account that through the life cycle of the project and therefore through its budget. So again, talking about time and on. Relating time to the budget. One concept and one tool that has been very useful for project managers is to develop the time phased project. It is different than a simple budget because a budget usually gives you just a general picture how much you're going to spend in each dish in direct costs and indirect costs and within direct costs. What are the items that you have and how much you are going to be? Spending or expecting to expand in these items. But when we talk about a time based budget, we look at time and pretty much the cash flow or the expenses, the outflow that will go through the life cycle of the project, and that will help us to really have a good understanding of our resources, how much money we have and how much money we have need to have every day, every week or every month with respect to the project.

So it helps us to really have a good understanding of the cash outflow and of course, of our cash of our cash flow. So when we build a project at a time phase budget. Uh, we need to use some of the things that we have already covered. In other words, we need to look at our cost. Direct and indirect costs and put them all together. Even though there are some project managers and organizations that has that have as a practice that they calculate their budget, not take into consideration the indirect costs, just the direct cost. Again, because of many reasons. One is because these are internal projects in which what is important is the amount of money that the project is going to be consuming, but not the supporting infrastructure or the indirect cost. And but there might be some other reasons why you would like not to include the indirect cost in your time based budget. And. And the only thing that we will use is the work breakdown structure that we have already set up. And remember, when we set up the elements of the workplace of the work breakdown structure, we are thinking that we're going to use those IDs, the work breakdown structure ID as a way that can be linked to account within our budget or items within our budget or in the accounting system that will help us to plan to build the budget and also to control the expenditures of that specific element or item within our work breakdown structure.

And the other thing, of course, is the schedule when things are supposed to be happening and what things are supposed to be happening and. So one really important tool that we need to understand how to use, because it is the first step to build a time phased budget is the resource loading chart. In a resource loading chart we have in our first column the World Breakdown. Work breakdown, structure, ID, and which is again in this case, the activities that we are going to be funding. And the second column we have the resources that this activity is going to be consuming so that it can be accomplished. And then we have a large section or a large column that has some sub columns. That is the time. And in the time we have how much of these resources we are going to be consuming by a given period of time. What I'm showing on the screen now is we're talking about weeks and we have week one, which again, I include some some details within that. That week I have three columns and we need to do the same thing for all the other weeks, which I don't showing here right now. I'm just showing week two total and week end on N number of weeks after that. But in week one, again, assuming that you're going to do this every week.

In week one. We need to have that first column, which is the unit in which we are going to be measuring these resources. We're talking about people, maybe man hours. If we're talking about machinery that we're going to be renting, it may be hours of working. And if we're going to be talking about some raw materials, let's say concrete, we may be talking about pounds. So and then the second column is how many of these units I want to be are we going to be using in performing this activity during this week? Okay. You see that we're talking about week one. So here is where we actually know what is the consumption of each of these resources per time unit that we would like to track or plan for. And then of course, there is a total which we multiply the the number of units that we're going to consume per week. And when we add them up into a total, it will give us the total of resource, one that we will use or total of resource. Two, that we will use per week or per total product lifecycle. When we do this in a time phased budget and we add the price of each of these resources per unit, then we are able to calculate the total cost of the project. As you can see, I have a lot of sums everywhere in this chart, but it's pretty much the same chart that we have before.

The only difference that we added, the cost per unit and the overhead that we would like to charge. And in a in the first week we have a total per week of cost per resource because this is important, because maybe we need to pay a contractor for their services. So we would like we would like to know how much we are going to be paying them and how much we're going to be charging them for doing the work. And towards the end there is this last column in which we total all the cost per. Elements of your work breakdown structure, meaning that we may know how much it's going to cost us to build. Let's say going back to the case of the car, how much it's going to cost us to build the engine, how much it's going to cost us to build the chassis, the interior, the transmission. So all these elements, we're going to be able to calculate the total cost. Additionally, we will be able to know how much we will need to spend by a given period of time during the life cycle of the project. In this case, I'm showing weeks, but it can be days or it can be months or it can be years quarters depending on how much micromanagement manager or macro manager you would like to be when you develop your budget or when you control the expenditures or the costs of your project.

So in this case, again, our weeks and and it's going to let us know how much we are going to be spending. We expect to be spending by each of the resources, by each period of time, by each element of the work breakdown structure. And again, as you see, there are sums everywhere that can help us to understand our overall cash outflow and our overall project cost. Additionally, we can use each of these total cost to find out if it is a good idea to subcontract or to bring a contractor or to outsource one of these activities to another company or to somebody else. And again, that's part of the beauties of doing this time phase budget and getting some details. So let's look at an example right now. So let's say that we need to build a foundation for a modular house and. Uh, we have a different elements of a modular house. Remember, we talked about the modules, a previous learning module, and. But now we're going to focus on the site and the site. We have two different areas. This is the work breakdown structure. So we have the internal areas of the sites or what it is close to where the house is going to be laid on. And we have the external areas or the landscape. And within the internal areas we have the foundation and we have some basic services like power and water and sewer, and then we have the landscaping close to the house.

And then in the foundation we have the structure and we have the cosmetic appearance of that structure. And within the structure we have a different work packages like removing trees, clean foundation level foundation, dig trench and build structure. So if we put these activities. In a Gantt chart, it will look like this. So we have some time estimation of for each of these activities and we know that I will take us about 12 days to complete the foundation and. Going through, removing sides, cleaning the foundation level, the foundation, dig trench and actually building the structure. If we build the resource loading chart, it will be like this. So we have. Activity. One point. One point. One point. 1.1. Removing sites then, of course, 0.2 Removing cleaning foundation 0.3 Level Foundation 0.4 Digging trench and 0.5. Building the structure, the duration, the duration of these activities is in the next column, and then we define the resources that we are going to be using in each of these activities or that we are going to be loading into each of these activities. So we define the resource, a type of resource, and we define the units that we will use per day. And then also we can also determine the cost per unit of each of these resources and what's the percentage of overhead that we will be charging.

Again, this is a all this has been assumed in our problem. This is what each of these machinery that we will use in this construction site actually looks like. And major question, what is the cost of each of these activities per day? Why do I want to know that? Well, because I need to have a money. To pay them every day. So I would like to know what is my cash outflow? Next question is what is the total cost of each activity and why do I want to know that? Well, maybe because I would like to bring a contractor or I would like to compare the cost versus what a contractor is telling me that the they can actually do it for us. So and maybe it is also an important question to answer because maybe I will decide to go with a different. Way of doing it, a different approach in which this activity may not be needed. And finally, what is the cost of the foundation structure, which again, may help me to realize if it is better to outsource or subcontract the whole building of the foundation structure, or even it will put the customer to think about if if they would like to go with that different type of foundation or to pick a completely different approach to have the house settle on on on the site.

So again, these are very important questions to answer. But if we put the crunch the numbers together based on what we have had and we have. Assuming this problem, here's how it looks like. So activity 1.1 and 0.1 are in day one, which has a cost of. $40,088 and same thing for day two. But we see that this activity lasts only for two days. So there is no more charges to the project after that date. Overall, cash flow is the total cost of the activity. But in day three we have two activities being performed in parallel. So therefore we have an increase in the cash outflow of the project and activity. Point two has a duration of just one day and activity 0.3 has a duration of two days. As we can see. So day three and day four and and then day five, there is just activity 10.4 that has a duration of one day and then activity 0.5, which is building the structure, has a duration of seven days and. So we are able to know the cost per day of this project or the cash outflow. We are also able to know the cost of that particular activity. And I would like you to focus now on Activity 0.3 and see how we need to add the cost of the day three and day four. And similarly similar for activity 0.1 or in the actually good scenario of activity 0.5, which we have seven days of cost that we need to add up.

So we have total cost of each of the activities of 8175 for activity 0.1 and the most expensive one. We can see it as being activity 0.5 $22,365. Of course, if we add them up, that is the total cost of our project, which includes the 25%. Indirect cost and the all the direct costs that we are identified in the previous slide. One thing that we can use to track the cost of a project is to use what is called the year to date accumulated scenario, which is when we add up each of the budget per day and and then we increase it towards the end of the project. And again, it's an accumulated one that will help us to have a different view of the project. The major point here that we need to think about is how much again micromanager or micromanager do we want to be in terms of cost? I have had people that I have worked with in which they have to track the cost of a project by hour. And what I have had some other people that have worked with that have tracked projects by month. So it depends again, on your environment. It depends how critical the money side of the project is going to be. Of course, as more money is invested, probably you will need to have a better look at what is going on and how the money is going to be used.

But again, that varies in terms of different environments and different projects and. So another thing that I want you to think about is, again, the. Uh, impact that being a micro manager or a macro manager will have upon the performance of the project manager. In other words, what I'm saying is that remember what we have talked before in previous learning modules that we need to be time managers scheduling, looking at the schedule and try to understand how well we're doing in terms of time. Also, we need to be good quality managers and we need to be human resource managers. We need to be risk managers. And now I'm saying that you need to be also a cost manager. So the project manager wears different hats and we cannot divert all the time and resources that a project manager has just to a given activity. So we need to be risk manager at the same time that we are cost managers and time managers. So we need to juggle all these different areas and try to find a balance that is the best balance for our project, which every time is different. So again, there is a trade off between how much you how much time you are going to divert or invest in doing each of these activities versus the benefits. And this is not an easy question for me to answer.

It's a question that you will need to realize by assessing the importance of each of these areas to your particular project. Another thing that we can do is to plot the accumulated budget as remember what I said the year to date. You add them up and look at the at the curve. And this is usually called the the baseline curve. Sometimes they call it the S Corp, but it is a curve that represents the budget through the life cycle of of the project. And it is good because it's a good representation and we can see how well we are doing when we plot the expenditures of the project and therefore we can begin to try to understand when really things went really well or went bad. This particular case I'm showing in orange, the cumulative cost or pretty much what we have paid to people and compare that with the budget that we set up before. And as we can see in day two, it seems like the the orange curve began to have a different. Trend than the cumulative budget curve and ending on about day five. So it was clear that something happened between day two and day five because because the cost went up or over what we planned for. And after that, it seems like the curve remains parallel with the cost of or the budget that we plan for. So it seems like everything seems to be fine, or at least around what we planned for the cost after that day five So we will need to really look at what really happened during day two on day five, because that is what actually makes us to have an overrun of our budget.

So again, this is how you can use this chart to pinpoint and to have a conversation on what actually went on in the project when related to the money side and the budget. So the expectation for your course project is that you're going to complete 20 activities and you're going to plan for them and you're going to build a pert chart and you're going to build a work breakdown structure. And you are also expected that to build a time phase budget. And in that time phase budget, you are expected to develop a resource loading chart and also you are expected to develop that time phase budget in which you are going to have at least three resources assigned per each of the 20 activities that you're going to be planning for. I led you to assume a percentage of overhead, and if you have no idea, let's use 25 or 30%, that's fine. And if you would like to build a baseline and draw it in a chart as I showed it before, that's fine too. But that is not expected. But it is a good way of representing the budget of your.

Right.

So let's talk about some issues in budgeting. While resource estimates and the actual requirements are rarely the same again, we are trying to predict the future. And and when we determine the direct costs and indirect costs of a of a project, we are assuming a lot of things. And so our planning is always different than our reality and we need to understand that so that we have always incurred in some errors in our estimations. And those errors can be of two types, those that are random, which in the end will have a balance. Let's say if, if I have random errors in my estimates, usually they tend to balance. In other words, the the amount of time that I overestimated this kind of the same amount of time that I underestimated. So that's what we call random towards the end. There is no trend. But when we talk about bias is when someone is, let's say, more pessimistic or more optimistic and they tend to overestimate or tend to underestimate. And and and that is, of course, a problem in the project environment because we need to account for those variabilities in our budgeting and estimation. So those are usually the major issues that we see in budgeting that we are trying to predict.

The future and the future may be completely different from the estimates that we're using. And we also need to account for individual characteristics as being one of having or not a bias in the way we put together budgets. So with this, I am completely in module number 13. Again, a very important module because we're talking about the time and the cost side of the project altogether. Pretty much what I'm saying is that we are building this time phase budget that is very important to have in a project because it helps us to understand our project cash outflow and help us to manage or to plan ahead for that cash outflow. And so a really important one is the money side of the project, how we actually will be. Predicting on how the the project will be used, financial resources and also how we would like to control it. Pretty much we would like to be micro manager or macro managers in terms of cost. So with this, I'm completing this module 13 and I look forward to see you and talk to you in module 14.",6712,"[-0.00278781 -0.02579425 -0.00858496 ... -0.01374381 -0.00470597

Project Leadership,16.0,PM,"Title: Project Leadership; Description: The video module for ENMA 604 will teach students about leadership and its role in project management. The module emphasizes the importance of understanding the social aspects of project management and covers various leadership styles and their pros and cons. It explores the characteristics of an effective project manager, including creativity, problem-solving skills, time management, and communication. The module emphasizes the importance of developing soft skills for success in project management careers.
The module discusses the different roles of a project manager, such as leader, facilitator, administrator of resources, political advocate, coach, mentor, and stakeholder leader. It emphasizes the importance of applying leadership skills rather than just talking about them and encourages students to practice and hone these skills for improved performance.
Throughout the module, key topics will be repeated, including the role and characteristics of effective leaders, setting mission objectives and strategies, and the concept of motivation and its impact on individuals and organizations. The module will also discuss power dynamics and the difference between managers who derive power from formal hierarchies and leaders who gain power from the people they lead.
Different leadership styles, such as coercive, authoritative, affiliative, democratic, pace-setting, and coaching styles, will be introduced. Each style will be discussed in terms of their modus operandi, when they are most effective, and their impact on climate and performance. The module will encourage students to reflect on individuals they have encountered who exemplify each leadership style.
The module will emphasize that there is no single best leadership style and that leaders should adapt their styles based on the project life cycle. A combination of democratic, authoritative, and coercive styles is recommended to achieve project goals and create a positive climate.
The module also stresses the importance of understanding project goals, requirements, and team structure. It introduces six leadership styles, including cohesive, authoritative, affiliative, democratic, coaching, and the Coleman model. Each style is discussed in terms of its application in different phases of the project life cycle.
The module concludes by advising students to practice applying these leadership styles with groups they trust and to build trust between themselves and their team members. It emphasizes that trust takes time to build and should be demonstrated throughout the project life cycle.
Overall, the video module aims to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of leadership in project management. It covers various leadership styles, their applications, and the importance of developing soft skills for success in project management careers.; Transcript: Hi, I'm welcome to Learning module number 16. Today we're going to talk about the leadership and how leadership is a key concept that we need to understand when we are managing projects. Uh, leadership is one of these soft topics that really makes this course at ODU very unique. We expand the technical side of project management into the soft side project management, which by many people have been suggested as being the most important aspect of a project manager that makes it very successful in the project environment. I have been doing a quick research every time that I teach this course and I have taught about 700 students and for about seven years and I always ask the same question What percentage do you think you will give to the technical side of the project management or the management side of the project? Management has been the most important, and a good average is always. Project managers say that about 70% of managing project is social and about 30% is technical. So in order to be successful, we really need to understand the social side. The social cognitive side of project management and leadership is just one of those topics that we are going to cover in this course that that will help you to become more skillful and knowledgeable in those soft topics. So let's look at the presentation. So we will talk about the different leadership styles in the project domain, pros and cons of those styles and the nature of project leadership.

So let's focus now on the project manager so the individual, hopefully the one that you are or the one that you're going to be and. I like a lot this quote from Kerzner that says the ideal project manager would probably have doctorate in engineering, business and psychology and experience with ten different companies in a variety of project office positions and would be about 25 years old. So our big joke, of course, and without trying to hurt anyone's feelings in any way. But let me. Cut and dice What he's pretty much saying here, read between the lines. Pretty much. So he's saying have doctorates in engineering, meaning that you understand very well the technical part of a project. Business that you understand the business side of the organization and treat projects as actually income generating initiatives. Psychology Because we really need to understand our stakeholders, meaning our team, our sponsor customers. And and that is critical, as I said, from the social standpoint. An experience with ten different companies in a variety of project office positions. So you probably be a project engineer or a project assistant, then assistant to the project manager, project manager, program manager and deputy program manager. So all these levels of. Jobs that you have had with experience and doing them will bring you a different perspective on really what affects the management of projects. And finally. Would be about 25 years old.

And so he's not talking about your biological age, but your spiritual age. So we need to really approach this projects endeavors with an open spirit. And because they really demand a fresh look at things, we embrace change. We really need to be proactive. So to those type of personalities that you think that everything can be prescribed and that nothing's going to change, of course, project management is a very tough environment. Some important characteristic of project management managers include the ones on the screen. That doesn't mean that these include everything, but I will tell you that if I pick any of these, I can talk for the whole hour just on a single one. But let's pick some of these and have an explanation and expand it. So, for example, they need to be creative. Why do they need to be creative? Because of the unpredictability of the environment. And you pretty much are going to need to, on the fly, come up with approaches that can help you, can help the team and the project to meet moving targets. Another one, they need to be they need to be good at identifying problems. Again, because pretty much what happens every day in the project environment is that we need to identify early. Our problems so that we can tackle them and very quickly before they can actually hit the whole project management system. The balanced use of time. Well, because you are pretty much a multitasker.

There are several things going on at the same time, and you need to oversee this and you need to understand the. Issue of prioritizing your time very well so that you devote. The most effort to the activities that really need it in the environment. And finally, the last bullet effective communicator and integrator. There is no way in which a project will go smoothly if you are not able to communicate very well with your stakeholders and to integrate people and technology and make sure that that you oversee how your project is impacting the system in which it's performed. And so again, there are many different important personal characteristics of project managers, but those that I talk. Good communicator, good multitasker, someone that is very creative, have a lot of soft skills that help them navigate through very complex environments, that those are the most important skills. So I just want to tell you a quick story about that. This particular university that is very well known, very expensive, and they, as you probably know, every time that someone graduates from a school, usually the school begins to send emails, the alumni association to donate money to the school, to support the school in many different ways. So this particular school, which is not all of you, was looking at what type of what is the profile of the students. That the. Provide more funds, more money back to their schools after they have graduated.

And, of course, the. The theory or the hypothesis was the higher the GPA of these students, the more successful they were going to be and the more money they probably will have to share with the school. So in reality, what they found was the opposite. They lower the GPA, the more that the actual students actually gave back to the school. And when they look that more in depth, what they found is that these students were students that were good enough to be admitted in this good school and good enough to remain in. College. But while they were doing this, I mean, what they were going to school, they were being either opening their own companies or being the leaders of some study clubs or societies or chapters within the within campus, in the university. And in other words, these students were developing social skills that really made the difference for them to become very successful in in their careers. So there is a phrase that says what you what brought you here is not what is going to take you to the next level. So they were good enough to get their degrees. But after you get the degree, the major difference between you and someone that has the same degree is actually your social skills. So you need to develop those social skills. And part of this course is actually focused on doing that. So what are the roles of project Manager? We can organize them in many different ways.

I like this way a lot because it gives you important aspects of what pretty much we do every day. We need to be leaders. We need to be facilitators of work. Meaning we bring resources. We assign resources to people. We make sure that things actually are happening and we administer resources, meaning that we plan and we control the resources that we get and we move into the politics. We make sure that we have in the project everything that we need and that we use in the more effective way we coach and mentor our the members of our project team and sometimes even some other project managers. And again, we lead the pack, we lead the the team and we lead the stakeholders that are related to our project. So let's talk about project leadership. What is leadership? Like a lot this very short definition because it gives you the right words when we talk about leadership. It's a process in which the leader persuade. Some individuals to pursue the leaders objective. And persuasion is so strong that we have seen through the history of our country and even of our world. How? Very good leaders have led countries to pretty much destruction. And so leadership is a very powerful concept phenomenon, socio cognitive phenomenon that can help those ethical leaders to become very successful. I like this quote a lot because it puts into perspective why you are coming to a school and taking all these courses.

In other words, this executive is saying, give me leaders, not people who know how to talk about leadership. So what I'm expecting that you actually do after you have taken this course is to put things in practice, not to begin to talk about. Yeah, there are six leadership styles and this is the leader style. No, actually, what I want you to do is to look at these leadership styles and see which one you can actually immediately apply and begin to hone those skills before you can actually start talking about them. So it is practice what we're looking here, it is actually the impact upon your performance and upon your capabilities and the performance of your unit and helping your boss to be a better boss and your organization to become a greater organization. So what is project Leadership? Using the same definition, moving now to the project environment is the process in which the project manager or a project leader, which may be a different than the project manager, persuades the stakeholders of the projects to work towards the goal of the project and. What do effective leaders do? They set a mission objectives, a vision of where the project is going. Set strategies of how people will align and resources will align with those tasks so that we can achieve that mission, those objectives, that vision.

We motivate people to move in the direction that we believe we all need to move. And the beauty of this leadership style is sometimes people really do not understand very clearly where they are going, but if they are motivated to follow the leader, they will go and do whatever the leader needs to do. So that is where motivation really gets into people and into their hearts and to actually move mountains and they build cultures. Remember, when we talk about organizational cultures, that's what leaders do. They set cultures by example. They set cultures by definition. They develop people, they develop the way that people interact. But in reality, what is expected from leaders is that they get they get the job done so and without harming anyone, of course. A really cool trick. If you want a silent room of executives, try this. Why would anyone want to be led by you? So ask them. Why would anyone want to be led by you? Now, I would like you to pause the tape and ask the same question to you. Why would anyone want to want to be led by you? Okay. So. An important topic that needs to be discussed in this learning module is the difference between management and leadership. So on the slide right now, I have a two columns on different aspects that we're going to use to compare the two. So what is a pure manager and what is a pure leader or pure management or pure leadership? And we will look at that in terms of the function power, focus, approach, status, dependence and purpose and what they actually serve.

In terms of function, pure management, organize plan, budget control evaluate. Very, very objective in terms of. Pure leadership. The function is more soft. Vision. Mission. Value. Culture. Very soft concepts. Phenomenons. Them of power. The power of the manager comes from a formal hierarchy from the organization. So it has been assigned in terms of leadership. It is personal leaders. Leadership comes from the people that is being led. The focus of the pure manager is to make sure that he does a good resource allocation and under the constraints that has been given to him, to her. And in terms of the leader, the focus is on human motivation and moving people and enabling change. In terms of the approach that the pure manager use is objective, it's numeric and very straightforward plans and and procedures. In terms of LIDAR, the approach is very emotional. It gets into the heart of the people to actually move and ask, motivate and persuade the people to move into a certain area or to a certain goal or exert a certain effort in terms of the static status of fear manager. Well, there it is, static. Again, it has been assigned by hierarchy, by someone up in the hierarchy of the organization. Therefore, it's a static until someone opened.

The organization would like to change it in terms of the leader. It is fluid. It changes throughout time. Someone may be leading a pack today and that someone may not be the same person leading the same pack next day and another leader actually emerge. So leadership is emergent and and comes and goes depending on on the situation and depending on the quality of the leader and dependence. Again, pure management depends on the high power that has been assigned to to it, to this function to work. So in other words, he use power that comes from the top of the organization to persuade people to do their jobs. And the dependence of the leader is all with respect to the people and the trust and respect that they have upon the the leader. So the worst thing that can happen to a leader is to have his or her integrity put down because of something that he or she did. So when you lose trust, it's very difficult to bring it back on. The purpose of the pure manager is to maintain stability and the next one is status quo. So to keep things as stable as possible and within the parameters, the performance parameters that have been given to to her, to him in terms of leadership, it is about inducing change and helping the group to evolve, to adapt to what is going on on the field at that point of time.

So it is changing and it's flexibility. We also call that resilience. We call that also agility in the environment. So but let me tell you something. There is not that thing of a pure manager or a that thing of being a pure leader. Somehow we have a spectrum that we and that is the orange double headed arrow that I have on top a spectrum in which people sometimes move and become more pure, more manager, pure leaders. And we have pretty much going back and forth on the two. There are very few instances that has been recognized in practice of individuals that have been extremely good managers and also extremely good leaders at the same time. But those are very rare. And one example is Jack Welch, the GE, the GE CEO for many years, even though later in his career he got some personal drawbacks, He's still being recognized as a really good manager and and a really good leader of that extremely large organization. So let's talk about these different leadership styles. We have the work from Goldman in which he came up with this categorization or classification of different leadership styles. And if you would like to see different categorizations or taxonomies of leadership, just go online and type leadership style and you see that there are many outside. So this one that I'm bringing to you today. It's one that has been very well recognized and one that I like a lot.

But you can find many other different ones. And if you really go and understand what they mean, you'll see that they are pretty much the same, but just with different labels or different names. So the work that Goldman did, he looked at the different leadership styles and he saw how the leadership style affected the leaders work unit, the climate of that unit, and how the climate is related to the performance of the unit. So he again, by a change of relationship, he was able to link the leadership style to the performance of that unit. He identified six leadership styles, and that goes from coercive to authoritative affiliative democratic pace setting and coaching. He did this research with more than 3000 executives and came up with a very good. Classification and explanation of the pros and cons of these leadership styles. So as I go through these leadership styles, I'm going to pause and I will like you to think about people that you have known that have exerted. Any of these leadership styles. So this first one is the cohesive leader. Uh, the modus operandi of this leader. He or she demands immediate compliance to his or her order. Uh, this style in a phrase is do what I tell you to do. When this style works best in the middle of a crisis, when you really need to have a strong leader pointing where we need to go.

Uh, to kick start turnaround because the way that you were going was not good when you have. Problems with some employees in which you really need to direct and what they need to do. Of course, because it's too strong into the people. It was found by Goldman as having a negative impact upon the climate and therefore upon the long term performance of that unit. So I would like to pass here a few seconds. Think about someone that you have seen exerting this coercive leadership style. Okay, so keep going now to the next leadership style authoritative. The modus operandi of this leadership style is. The leader moved people towards a vision, but also give the people the means to reach that vision. So it is a combination of. Go here, but also I'll help you to go there. So the styling of phrase is, Come with me, let's go there. Let's go towards that vision when it works best, when we need to set up a new vision and there is a change that needs to be implemented in an organization. And when you need someone that actually provides a clear path, a new direction, where we all need to go. Coleman found that this is the leadership style with the most strongly positive impact upon the climate of the organization under the long term performance of the organization. So pause here and I will ask you to think about someone that you have met in your career, that you have seen that has applied this type of leadership style.

Okay. Moving to the next one, the affiliative leadership style in which the modus operandi is to create harmony and build emotional bonds across your people and from the people around you. And this style of people always come first besides work. Besides money, besides any other thing, people is always the first and the most important thing. And this style works very well when you have some friction on some level of personal conflict going on in your team. And this also helps to motivate people when they are going through very tough job assignments or through very tough personal circumstances. So of course, because of the focus on people, it has a very strong impact upon the climate. And again, it has, as a consequence, a good impact upon the performance of the of the long term performance of the unit. Well, I didn't give you time to think about the previous one, but just pause and think about someone that has been a good. Person or have exerted this very people's focused leadership style. Now let's think about the next leadership style, the Democratic. In this one, the leader tries to forge consensus or achieve consensus by asking people to provide inputs into his or her decisions. So this starting of phrase is what do you think that we need to do? What do you think that we need to go? What? We need to go.

How do you think we can do this thing? So it provides it requests a humongous amount of inputs from the people that he or she is leading. So it's great to create consensus and build synergy and to have a to articulate the needs of a very important and knowledgeable employees and stakeholders into the project. So and because again, of the focus on people, it has a it was found to have a positive impact upon the climate of the work unit and upon the performance of the unit. So think about someone that you have seen exerting these type of leadership style and. I'll give you a few seconds. Okay. Moving to the next one, the LIDAR data is a is exerting a pace setting style. These type of leaders set up visions, but also a level of performance. So they demand that you do as they do, but do it now and. And because again, of the major thrust on pushing people to the extreme, it was found by Goldman as having a negative style. And it works very well when you have a highly competent, highly motivated team working for the leader. And when you push them very hard, they probably probably will feel fine for a while, but they are able to respond. When you keep this style for a while, you may have some negative consequences and we will talk about the negatives in the in the next slide.

So think about someone that has exerted this type of pace setting style in your career and personal life or in any type of environment that you have seen, either directly or indirectly. So a few seconds. Okay, so the final one is coaching. This is the leader that focuses on preparing people for future assignments and for their careers and. Is very difficult to find these type of leaders nowadays because we are so busy doing some other things that the last thing that we think about is that we need to help our replacement. Actually, that is the first job of any leader to figure out who is going to replace. Him or her so that he or her can actually begin to go up in the ladder of the organization. So it's so important that we prepare someone that to take over our position so that we can move forward. So starting a phrase, try this. Don't do that in this way. Do it in this way. So it's pretty much the analogy of the baseball coach and when the style works best. When the employee wants to improve performance and when the employee wants to develop better capabilities. So there is some motivation to learn there in the employee and and some ability, of course, of learning as well. So because of the focus on people, it was found by Goldman of having a good impact upon the climate and therefore upon the performance.

Even though there are some of these that have a positive. Impact upon the climate. They are all they all have a negative side and we will talk about that negative side now. They coercive leadership style has the issue that if you keep being coercive for so long in this unit with these people, you are pushing them so hard that you are harming their morale, their morale and their feelings. So they might keep up with you because that's the only option that they have, but they really don't like to be there. So and they probably don't like you as well. The authoritative has there's a downside downside that if you have people that you are leading that feel that they know more about that area that you are working on than the leader, then they may feel like you are pushing them to do things that you you shouldn't and you may be perceived as arrogant and may again be hurting the spirit of the team because they know that there is a different way of doing it that is better than what the leader is pushing people to actually do. The other one affiliative. The problem if you become too people oriented, is that that they may feel that mediocrity is tolerated. So be careful because it is good to be people oriented, but you also need to wear other. Leadership styles had to prevent that.

People feel that they can do anything that they want. And because, again, you support people so much. The Democratic style has the issue that I guarantee that most of you have lived at least one once in your career. That is, that you go to these meetings, professional meetings, and you see people talking and talking and talking and asking, What do you think? And it seems like that meeting will never end because again, what do you think and what do you think? So I don't know you, but I have been in these type of meetings many times and it really gets to a point that it annoys and because, okay, now what we need to move forward. So in other words, it is fine for a while, but someone needs to stop and say, okay, based on what we have covered, here's what we need to do and move forward. In terms of downsides of pace setting. Because the leaders have set up a pace of action so strong into the team. If all of a sudden that leader disappears and there is no communication or he or she had to do something else and leave it and left the team by by itself, they will feel. They will feel clueless on what they need to do because again, they will never ask what they had to do and they were never given the initiative to. Propose what they had, what the team had to do and how it had to do it.

So they pretty much. Sit down style and nothing will happen. And finally, the downside of coaching is that you can coach people that are willing to learn, but if they are not motivated to learn anything, then you're going to be wasting your time. So it depends on the people that you're going to be working with. So I think that by now you have already gotten got the clues that I was saying that there is not a single particular leadership style, that it is good. It is the combination of those styles. Moreover, those with positive impact upon the climate, the combination of them is really what have made a great leaders as recommended by Goleman and I agree. So you can not exert the same style for so long. You can change hats all the time for for example, you can be in a meeting and be very democratic in the beginning, but then actually you can be in a meeting and be very authoritative and say, Here's what the meeting is about, here's what we're trying to accomplish. Then open and change your style to be democratic. As for people participation and probably towards the end, just after you have for some consensus, move to coercive and say, here's what we're going to do and close the meeting and move forward and give the direction and ensure that everybody has the means to go to that vision.

So I would like you to stop the tape here. And try to answer this question at which phase of the project life cycle would you apply each of these leadership styles and remember the project life cycle as the conceptualization phase in which we define the requirements defined? Who is the project manager? The team? All that. Then comes the planning, which you plan. We plan how we're going to meet the objectives and the requirements, execution and control in which we implement the plan and deploy the plan and execute the activities and then closure or termination. So I would like you to stop here the tape for a few minutes and think about this and write, draw, draw a project life cycle, and think about how these six leadership styles will fit in or will fit better in each of these phases of the life cycle. Okay. So you probably have come up with several different ideas, for example, and let's go back and revisit them as we go. The cohesive style may work well when we need to start the project and bring people very quickly and and say, here's how we're going to do things and then leave them. It also may work very well if there is a problem during the execution phase of the project to bring people really back on track on what they need to do. And but you will do it, as I said before, just for a few days or very short time.

To don't harm too much the morale of the people and maybe towards the end of the project if we need to close the project terminated very quickly. Again, that might be a way of of doing it. The authoritative will be very nice to be applied at actually any phase of the project life cycle. Again, it provides a vision. Moreover, in the beginning of the project, because it provides the vision. But remember that in each phase there are different goals that we are planning to achieve. So there are different visions or pieces of the visions that we're going to be applying through the project life cycle. And so I will use this one cut across this one, across all the phases of the project life cycle. Affiliative. I will say that I'll probably use it in the beginning when we're trying to build the team and understand that you will create this what we call we develop the team and create some bonding before we begin. And actually. I will use it once in a while during the life cycle of the project to make sure that we keep people motivated to move forward and don't keep an environment that is too rigid, too technical. The Democratic would be very nice during the planning phase of the project, asking for participation on how they actually think we need to accomplish the project requirements of the project objectives.

Best setting. Again, if there is something that went bad during the execution of the project, it will be very nice actually to help the people to go back to the pace and go back on track on what they had to do will be very good. Also, towards the end of the project determination to be sure that we increase the pace and we close the project in a very nice way. Finally, coaching will cut across all the faces because that's something that you will need to do every day. Prepare the people for the future, show them how things look when they are done right. Help them to learn how to do or show them how to do the things right and then enforce them to do things right. And so going to the. Exercise. So I hope that this helps you to bring some ideas on how it will apply. Remembering the project environment. Everything is different depending on the objective of the project and the environment. So you may find out that some of these styles that I just told you and the application to some phases will apply better or not applied at all in the environment in which you are, which is fine. So. Another very good leadership model, different from the Coleman focus on people and actually the trust and the supportive behavior that the leader needs to give. And I would like you to focus first down into the four different levels of competence that of the people that is going to be led.

And red is when they have low competence in the task that they're going to do. Orange is when they have some competence, but they are not that good yet. Yellow, they are becoming good. So they have some good level of competence in the task. And green is when they are really good in the task that they're going to do. And so we as leaders, we need to understand that we may need to change our leadership style depending on the abilities that or the competence of the people that we're going to lead in certain tasks in the project environment. So this. These are models which I changed a little bit because in the way that is actually done by Hirsch and Blanchard, the arrows going in a different sequence. So I just wanted to give it in a more flowing from left to right sequence, let's put it that way. So in the first left down side, we have the red low competence people and we. Direct them on what they need to do. And we do not provide any type of supportive behavior. It's very much a coercive, authoritative style. Here's what you need to do and move forward in the next one. In the orange, we coach them and we know that in coach, we support them, we give them the direction, but also we help them to develop those skills that they need to to have in order to do this activity very well.

So we again, provide a lot of coaching back and forth to help them to hone their skills. Now they move into this moderate competence stage in which they pretty much at that level know a lot of what they need to do, but they are still honing their skills. But at this level, we. Kind of step back in terms of telling them what they need to do. They are more able to come up with creative ways of achieving their objectives. But we still have high supporting behaviors because we are developing them and we are still in other words, we are kind of still coaching them and helping them to develop the skills. Finally we have the green level in which they have high competence. And to the leaders, this is pretty much what you would like to have everybody in your team or the people that you are leading. At that point, they are very competent and because they have gone through this directing, coaching, supporting and delegating cycle, you trust them and you know that they are going to perform at the level that you are expecting. So you exert low directive and low supportive behavior. You pretty much don't need to tell them too much what they need to do. I don't need to actually be on top of them, helping them to hone skills.

So an important topic here that I want to bring is that if you bring someone with a lot of experience to work with a new leader, it doesn't mean that immediately this person is going to go to the green level because this model talks about competencies, but also talks about the trust between the leader and the people that he is leading. So they will need to demonstrate capabilities as going through the life cycle. Okay with this? I'm completing this learning module that is again a very important one. I hope that that you began to try to hone your leadership styles. From tomorrow on, I recommend you to find some group of people that you trust and explain them what this leadership style is about and trying to help try to induce them using these leadership styles and tested to see how it goes. Of course, it needs to be a group of people that provide support to you, and I recommend either close friends and family members in the beginning and then try with them and then moving to very trusted colleagues and see how it goes. And so again, I hope that through this learning module you have learned some important concepts of of leaders and, and that can help you to become a very good leader and also a really good manager in the future. So hope to see you in the next learning module. Module 17. Thank you.",7467,"[-0.02292324 -0.00184865 -0.00759266 ... -0.00104482  0.00392178

Managing the Project Team,17.0,PM,"Title: Managing the Project Team; Description: The video module for ENMA 604 will teach students about the key topics related to team performance and individual development. The module focuses on the changes that occur within a team, such as the development of new norms, roles, communication patterns, processes, and knowledge. These changes in the team ultimately impact the individual team members by acquiring new knowledge, skills, abilities, attitudes, and motivation. The module emphasizes the importance of mental models and situational awareness in enhancing team performance.
Key aspects of team performance include the quality, quantity, timeline, mistakes, and cost compliance of the team's products and outputs. The feedback loops between task and individual characteristics and team characteristics play a significant role in either positively or negatively impacting the team spirit. A high-performing team is defined as one that meets both technical and human performance aspects, ensuring satisfaction, learning, and reputation.
The module also provides guidelines for developing cohesive teams. During the kickoff meeting, teams are encouraged to answer questions as a group, including identifying their knowledge-based and attitude-based capabilities, as well as their skills-based capabilities. The team is advised to define their expectations for technical and human performance, set clear norms for organization and communication, and establish roles and responsibilities. The importance of continuous improvement throughout the project life cycle is emphasized, and teams are encouraged to use approaches such as the PDSA cycle to plan, execute, study, and act to improve their performance. It is highlighted that technical performance alone is insufficient, and human performance, including satisfaction and reputation, is equally important.
Overall, the video module provides a comprehensive understanding of team performance, individual development, and the factors that contribute to a high-performing team. Students will gain insights into the dynamics of team changes, the significance of mental models, and the importance of satisfying stakeholders and fostering a positive team environment. The guidelines presented will aid students in developing effective and cohesive teams and continuously improving their performance throughout the project life cycle.
In this video module, as the instructor of ENMA 604, you will learn about the concepts of reflection and improvement. One tool that will be discussed is the Start Stop Continue organizational development tool, which is recommended for individuals, teams, and organizations. This tool involves taking the time to answer three important questions: What should I begin doing to achieve my goals? What should I stop doing to achieve my goals? What should I continue doing to achieve my goals?
The video will also cover the project execution phase, where the project manager plays a role in helping the team improve and develop their problem-solving, decision-making, conflict resolution, communication, coordination, and adaptability skills. After completing a task, after-action reviews will be conducted to reflect on achievements and generate knowledge for future actions. Team development activities will be introduced, such as community service projects and exercises that enhance team communication, conflict resolution, decision-making, and adaptability. 
It's important to reward the success of the team as a whole rather than individuals, in order to foster team spirit. The video will discuss the concept of an end-of-project celebration to recognize and reward the team's efforts. Different ways to reward the team will be explored, including low-cost options like face-to-face congratulations and personal notes, as well as more costly rewards such as promotions, bonuses, and time off. Recognizing and appreciating the team's efforts is crucial for building high-performance teams that contribute value to the organization.
The video concludes by emphasizing the importance of providing the team with the necessary capabilities to operate as a high-performance team. This includes providing the team with the necessary resources, training, support, and empowerment to excel. By investing in the team's development and creating a supportive and empowering environment, project managers can help their teams reach their full potential and achieve project success.; Transcript: Hi and welcome to module 17. We're going to be talking about managing the project team and which is a topic again on the soft side of project management. And it is really important because as far as I know, a project is not of a single person, not only of the project manager, so you will need to work with your team. So we are talking about today about these important concepts of, of a team, team performance, team operations, team processes that will help us to really understand what's going on during the project from a team perspective. So let's look at the presentation. So we're going to talk about teams and teams development and some guidelines that will help us to. Uh, develop themes and make them be very effective. So we will discuss what is the team, understand the project work system and understand the project team performance and how we measure actually project performance. And strategies that will help us to develop socially. Our project team. So what is a team? Very short definition that goes to the point. It's a set of two or more individuals who must interact and adapt to achieve a specified, shared and value objectives. Let's cut and dice this definition. First is a set of two or more individuals. So that thing of having a team of one. That is is not a team. That's something different. And we must interact and adapt. So we need to have some level of communication and adaptation across the members of the team.

And we need to adapt to different styles of other people. And it is a really a very rewarding from my point of view. Experience when you do it well. In order to achieve a specified share and value objectives. So these objectives are value and are equal. To all the members of of the of the team. So and actually that is what makes different a team out of a group. A group comes together but they may not value the same objectives and they may not interact that much. So, for example, a society, you may have people in a society that never talk to each other and. And again, they are there just because of of social the social aspect or because they want to move the body of knowledge by giving domain, for example, a society of project management. But that doesn't mean that they have the same value upon the objectives and upon the. Intentions of being together. So when we have a team, they interact. They must interact with with each other to some level to achieve the goals of the team. Some team characteristics. Again, these these are not all that you can find outside, but the most important one, as described by Salas, they need to have meaningful task interdependencies. And this is what doesn't exist in groups. Meaning that my task impact someone else's task and impact someone else's task.

And there is a interrelationship across the inputs, processes or operations and the outputs of the task that are going to be performed by the members of the team. They have shared and value objectives. Again, is shared because they cut across all the members of the team and they all value because they know that the objectives are going to be the level in which they achieve The objectives are going to be one of the key performance metrics that they're going to use to measure the performance. They are hierarchically organized. The project environment. The chief is the project manager. But we also may have some leaders, some emergent leadership going on within the team. So we may have people in charge of high level items in your work breakdown structure and then some other people being charged in low level items of the work structure. And consequently that gives some level of hierarchy within the project team. They have specialized roles and responsibilities. We talk about the responsibility matrix in the previous learning modules, but we also need to understand that they have specialized role, meaning that they are either engineers, electrical engineers, accountants or specialists in, let's say, cryogenics so we know what someone is capable to do and we assign that person to the specific task that they can perform. Hopefully, if you have everything, everybody with the capabilities that you need.

Then the use of multiple information sources. As I said and the first the last two bullets actually talk about pretty much the same thing, which is they need information in order to function. And that information, it will be collected through intensive communication processes. So our team is all the time communicating. That is why it's so important that anyone in the team has really good communication skills so that it doesn't bring down the level of work that is being achieved or is being produced through the team. So what is teamwork? It is when the members of the team interact, work together, adapt. They have shared goals and and they make sure that they scan the environment so that any change that happens in the environment, it is immediately considered within the team for the team's sake. So it is a very powerful skill in any one nowadays. So let's talk about a very simple model of what is a team. On the left side, we have what is called the team capabilities, and that includes knowledge, skills, ability, resources and infrastructure. Anything that makes the team capable to perform the team's operations. Then we have the team operations in which the team communicates, perform the tasks and and those tasks. Actually define the the level at which the team has performed. So in other words, we can measure how well the team has met the objectives, but also how well the team have worked together.

As you see, there are two feedback loops going into going from the team performance to the team's operations and from the team performance to the team capabilities. The one that goes to the team's operation means that if the team performance has been. Good or let's say a really positive one. So the team is producing things that are of a lot of value that may impact how the team is going to operate and manage the next set of activities in the future. The other feedback goes to capabilities, meaning that the team may begin to learn how to work better together and impact, let's say, the ability to. Our coordinate better work. It also means that if the team was able to accomplish something ahead of time, now the team's capabilities change because they have more time to do it. Same thing would be if the performance is not good, they don't have enough time, so they are not now enough capabilities. And if the performance was really bad, maybe the team's morale is going to impact the team's operations and therefore there is a negative feedback going into the team's operation and team's capabilities. So a very simple one. Here's a very complex model of a team. So in this model, we have different elements that are important to be recognized when we talk about teams. The left side of the screen.

We have organizational characteristics in which this is the context in which the team actually works and function. Resources allocation reward system, organizational climate uncertainty. All this will impact the operations of the team. I will even add more into like the vision mission goals that has been set to this team. All that is going to impact the team's operations. Then what we see is that we have on top A. Concept called team task characteristics. These task characteristics are pretty much put together the aspects of the task that the team needs to work on in those tasks. We talk about task complexity. They are very complex task type. These are tasks, let's say, and this is where we can get very specific in the technical domain. If it is electrical engineering or mechanical engineering task task organization, how are we going to bring the people together and how they actually impact each other, meaning inputs, operations and outputs of all these activities all interrelated? So this is how, again, we define the task of the team down. We see on the slides that we have individual characteristics and here is what the team bring, the members of the team brings into the team and we talk about the ability, the knowledge, skills and abilities related to the tasks that they need that needs to be accomplished. It means other type of general abilities that may not be related to the task that needs to be completed.

Like, for example, some someone is able to speak in German, but again, this is a project that is being performed in the United States. So what is a general ability that may be proved to be needed if the team needs to somehow, during the project life cycle to communicate to some German supplier, let's say, motivation, how motivated is the the individual to work in the team attitudes? Are we bringing with a positive attitude in which we see opportunities rather than threats, personalities, which is again critical? Some people are introvert, some are extroverts. So we need to account for different personalities that we may have in in the in the members of the team mental models. Moreover, the shared mental models, how we can actually be able to understand the performance and the objectives of the team in the same way. Then we move into work structure. How are we going to make sure that we align the people to work in their tasks? So in other words, this is where, for example, the responsibility matrix works very well because we align people to the task. It is also when we bring together assign who is going to be in charge of each activity and also who is going to be the project manager and all that. So we give structure to the work that needs to be done and we also define what is going to be the roles and norms.

And we will see this in the next slide and how we are going to communicate while we perform this team. The next one is team characteristics, which is when the team begins to be put together and understand what are the resources that they will have. And it is pretty much how we define the team or the team capabilities. So how we distribute power within the team. Again, it is related to the hierarchy in the in the within the team. It's related to the resources and that the team has and that have access to and or that has been assigned to the team. It also referred to the level of. Homogeneity that we have within the team. In other words, if all the members of the team are mechanical engineers or all the members of the team are administrators. So how homogeneous or not is the team? And it has been very well known in research that has been performing in a project teams that. The team that is very homogeneous will be good to complete certain predictable tasks. But when the team is required to become to produce new ways of doing things or produce knowledge or or create new things, it is better to have a team that is not homogeneous or heterogeneous so that there is conflicting information. And it seems seems that that somehow triggers thoughts and creativity in teams and and overall team climate on how well the team is holding together.

After that, it goes into the heart of the team's operation, which is called the Team processes, in which coordination, communication, coughing resolution, decision making, problem solving, and a boundary spanning or boundary management, which which means going out, eat and out of the team to collect the resources that the team needs to operate happens in a very ad hoc way. So there are some type of team interventions that usually managers perform to keep the team at the at its finest level. And here is where we provide training to the team in the areas that they need. In which we provide individual training. If there is an individual that is lacking some skills or some knowledge. This is where we perform some of the team dynamics that will help us to build, to develop the team or to develop socially the team. And here is where the project management, leadership and styles really influence how the team works together. The three blocks on the right hand side explain the outputs of the team's operations and includes changes in the team, the performance of the team and changes in the individual. Changes in the team means that maybe new norms that the team is developing for working better in the future new roles based on the experience of some that had that some people have gained through the project.

New communication patterns based on what we have found that works better. New processes because again, we have discovered better ways of working or not so better ways of working and new knowledge that has been developed by working together. So that's how the team changes the individual and the down changes by acquiring new knowledge, skills and abilities, new attitudes, and changing the level of motivation to good or bad. After these operations, mental models now are critical because the teams are the team are getting more close together, hopefully, and understanding, having a situational awareness that is shared across the members of the team. In terms of team performance, we always talk about quality. The quality of the products and outputs, quantity of the products generated timeline in which they provide the outputs to the customer, mistakes or errors that have been made and the effect that they have upon the image of the team and the cost compliance, which is also critical. As you see, there is a feedback that goes into the task characteristic and individual characteristics and then the whole thing goes back all over again. You can see all these feedback loops being positive and impacted, impacted, impacting in a good way. The team characteristic and the individual characteristics. However, if it is negative, it can harm the system and it is a closed loop, so it will probably destroy the team spirit in a downward spiral.

So let's define this concept of high performing teams. High performing teams are those that meet the two important aspects of performance. One is technical performance and the other one is the human performance. Think a performance from the project management standpoint has been very well known that we talk about these triple constraints. Time, budget and quality. So we would like to be on time. We would like to be. On budget and we would like to be delivering the product and services at the quality level expected by the customer. Human performance, however, extend the definition of project performance to include the stakeholders satisfaction, satisfaction of the project manager. Satisfaction of the members of the team. Satisfaction of the customer. Satisfaction of the sponsor. Human performance also include the learning that has been generated through this project because it's as important as the technical performance, because this is what will enable the team and the organization to do better the next time. And finally, the reputation that the organization is or the team or the project manager is achieving after a project is actually completed. Let me tell you something. I have worked in projects which are the technical performance we have been on or ahead of the time line, the timeline set by the customer. We have we have been on or below the budget set by the customer. The customer have loved the quality attributes of the products and or services that we have produced.

However, from this human standpoint. Uh, we have been extremely dissatisfied to a point that the customer may say, Well, I can find people that can or companies that can do the same project at the same level of technical performance, but that they will make my life so much easier. Similarly with me, I have worked in projects that have been great. But if you ask me, let me back up. There has been great from the technical performance point of view, but if you ask me if I would like to work with that project manager again, I will tell you forget about it. Why? Because this person made my life miserable during the project life cycle, and so I didn't enjoy it and even began to think about this. This is how things are going to happen around here. Maybe I will need to go someplace else. So. It is important that we recognize that the if we measure the performance of a project only from a technical point of view, we are missing the whole picture. Of a project performance. And I will even say that technical performance is as. Important as human performance. When you bring satisfaction learning and the reputation created during the project. So let's talk about some guidelines that has been identified that helps very well to develop teams and and pretty much to social develop the team to become more cohesive, more one unit rather than a group or a.

An accumulation of of. Members. So here's who the first part of the guideline during the kickoff meeting and the kickoff meeting, the project environment means that first meeting that the team is having in which everybody is introduced to each other, sometimes the customer comes and some key stakeholders come to that meeting, but at the team level, we would like for them to get together and answer these questions as a team. So in other words, you can use these slides and provide it to them so that they can walk through these phases and. Answer to each other these questions. So who are we? What knowledge based capabilities do we bring? So what is what we know? What has we What has been the training that we have got? The education, the experience that we have had? Of course, all that with respect to the tasks that the team has been given to perform next one, what is the attitude based capabilities that we're bringing? So am I a type of pessimist or a more optimist? So how do I see the world? So what type of skills based capabilities do we bring? So am I very good at programming? Very good at. Speak in different national languages. So what are those skills that really makes me different or that can help the team to perform better? The task that has been given to.

Next thing is what do we want to accomplish from the technical performance point of view on time, on the budget? And producing the quality attributes needed by the customer. From the human performance point of view. What is the level of satisfaction that we're expecting to get? How much learning do we get? Do we want to get through this project? What is the level of reputation? It is amazing that when we began to talk about these expectations. You will begin to see that pretty much everybody in the team has different levels of expectations and that we need to come together as a team to really find out who is for the sake of the team and who is actually seeking personal agendas. And you immediately can see that in the team. Actually, if there is a lot of trust, someone will say, Well, you know what? I am in this team because someone asked me to be here, but I don't want to be here. So immediately that is a red flag, meaning that this person shouldn't be working in any critical task because his or her performance may hamper the whole performance of the project. Next thing is how do we organize? Again, going back to what I just said is where we make sure that we develop roles. Who is going to be in charge of what? Who is going to be talking to the customer or not talking to the customer? The link with other developers.

What are the norms? When are we going to meet? What time? We are not supposed to be late or if we are late we are supposed to call. And so these are the type of things that we need to make sure that we set very clear since the beginning. If you want a template to develop norms, look at the team processes and try to come up with norms with respect to all the team processes, for example, communication, how how are we going to communicate? Meaning. Channels, meaning different messages that we would like to send. Between the team and other members of other teams or the team and the project manager. What about conflict resolution or decision making or boundary spanning going out of the team to gain some knowledge or resources? So all those norms needs to be set since that first day and the team is the one that needs to set that by itself. So management can help, but at this point the team needs to be. Let's say we can facilitate the discussion, but we should not push too much on how the team is going to be doing their work together. Next thing is, how are we going to make sure that we continue to improve through the life cycle of the project? So there are different ideas on how to do this thing, but the team will need to come up with the ideas that they find that it will work better for the team.

For example, some ideas that have worked well in the past is using the PDSA cycle. So we plan, we execute, we study the outputs, and then we act and make sure that we do things better the next time. So there should be, as a reflection point on what has happened and how we can change our performance the next time. Another one somehow related to the PDSA. Is what we call the start stop, continue organizational development tool. And in this tool, which is extremely powerful, with one that I recommend everybody to do, not only. At the team level in your job, but in your house and at the individual level. Because, again, it provides a lot of reflection. So the concept is that we stop one day and take a few minutes or hours, whatever we need. And try to answer these questions. What should I begin to do in order to get to wherever I want to go? What should I stop doing in order for me to get what I want to be in a year or two years, in a month from now? And what should I continue doing in order for me to get there at the team level? Of course we will say how we what? What should I. What should we stop doing and start doing and continue doing? And it can be done at the organizational level, facilitating a large group of people thinking.

But again, it can be also done at a small group level or at the individual level. So what do we need to start, stop and continue doing so that we can achieve our dreams? So. Now let's move into the project execution phase. So all that was at the project kickoff meeting. So now the team is executing, executing their task. And at this point the project manager will like to help to improve the team and develop the team in refining their knowledge, skills and abilities at the team level on how they are actually solving problems, making good decisions. Solving some conflicts, communicating at the team level, coordinating and adapting to the issues that they face every day and reflecting and learning as a group. So these are six key. Team processes that we need to make sure that we help the team to develop. Some team development development activities. As I said before, during the project life cycle includes the. After action reviews, which is similar to the plan do study Act. After we have accomplished a task, we come together and we reflect upon the level at which at which we achieved that task and and that generates knowledge that will help us to act. And in the next time that we do something similar, we can also do the start stop, continue to help us improve and gain some knowledge.

But also we can perform some team level activities that will help us to strengthen these team processes. For example, I have had here at the school the opportunity to be the faculty advisor of a group, and when that group came together there was a bunch of engineers to be that were pretty much everybody was introvert. Nobody wants to be the president of the team of the group. And it was really difficult for us to put that group of people to move ahead that chapter. So student chapter. So. The president of the chapter was elected by me by actually picking someone from the group because no one wanted to actually volunteer to be the one. And I was lucky. I picked a guy that had a really good idea on how to do this thing, even though he was very introvert. So he said, Hey, Prof. I think that the best way that we can do at this point to bring the team together or the group together is to do something that adds value. And that brings us in an activity that we need to interact. And I said, okay, what do you recommend? So there is this competition that happens every year in the Hamptons road area that is called construction can as a can food construction, and the team comes together and build structures that can be again, can mimic characters from movies or it can be a ship.

So you build a structure using canned food or packaged food. And in the end, that food is donated to the local food bank. And actually construction, if I'm not mistaken, is a is almost a global phenomenon nowadays. It can be found in many different countries. So the team came together and by resolving problems, by going and asking for donation, by having fun together out of the school environment, they really got to be one of the strongest teams that I have ever seen and have the ability, the opportunity to work with this group of people really help each other to learn, even though they were in different career paths. But I haven't been able to put another group together like this one. So really powerful. Exercise to bring them together and do some community service to whatever level you may think. There are different other exercises that I recommend you to look at. You can go online and look at the team development exercise and you will see that you will get a humongous amount of ideas that you can actually implement in a very shorter timeline and with with the need of of less resources and. Theme exercises that probably can last ten minutes, five minutes at any point of time that can help to bring the team together and help them to have better communication, a better conflict resolution, a better decision making, a better adaptability.

And. After the project is over, we need to make sure that we reward success. One thing that we always forget as project managers is that this group of people that work with us during this project most likely are going to work with us. In another project in the future. So you are not going to disappear from the organization and they are not going to disappear from the organization. So we need to make sure that you are see your ground for future work with these people. So it is important that we recognize and reward those that did a great job during the project. And that means that we need to reward the team if the team actually deserve it. And a major mistake that has been made in the organization is try to reward the individual. The individual is when you reward the individual, then there is no team spirit anymore in the organization. So. How do we reward them? There is a concept called the end of the project celebration in which we bring the team together and we go to a different place than the office and we generate some attention from the organization and from the team so that we recognize them and recognize the effort that they have exerted through during the life cycle of that project. It is important that when you do this, you do it with style.

I have been in projects and in groups in which. They have tried to do. Good things and actually completely backfired. So. Just be sure that when you do it, you do it carefully. You use the right words and use the opportunity to. Showcase your leadership abilities and your personal qualities. It is not something that you need to rush and that you need to. It is not a one more thing that you need to check in a to do list. This is something that when you do it, you need to do it really because you want it and because you really feel that it's something that needs to happen. They will feel if you are not doing this because of the right way. And again, it is it is going to backfire on you and on your reputation. So you need to, again, to demonstrate sincere appreciation for your team and for everybody that was involved. All the things that you can do is provide rewards. There are some very low cost rewards that are really powerful to recognize people. Simple face to face. Shake hand. Congratulations. A really powerful one that I have seen that people have appreciated pretty much in an equal way. Every time that I have seen it is a personal note from someone up in the organization. So if you have a good relationship with the senior leadership of the organization, ask them to write a thank you note.

Uh, two members of the project team, and you'll see how this is something that they will really value. A thank you note on your side also is important. And again, it's just a notepad that you need and handwritten even better than an email. So low cost launch certificate store certificates. Of course you will need to know what is what they like to do, what you need to talk and ask them and some other costly ones. Promotion, bonus and time off, which seems to be something that cut across everybody. So it means like no one will say no if you are asking them to have some time off from from the job. So. With this, I am completing the module 17 and as I said, it's a very important learning module because we are talking about the the team which is in the heart of the project. They are the ones that are going to be adding value to the organization or creating the program or developing the software or providing the service to the customer. So we really need to appreciate their effort and we really need to be sure that we provide them with the capabilities that they need to operate at what we define as a high performance team or a high performance project, which is the equal of technical performance and human performance. So with this, I'm completing this module 17 module, and I will see you in module 18.",6803,"[-0.02780678 -0.02006362  0.00696489 ... -0.01253811 -0.00274869

Project Audits/Reviews amd Closure,21.0,PM,"Title: Project Audits/Reviews amd Closure; Description: In module 21 of ENMA 604, we will focus on project reviews, audits, and closure. We will delve into the importance of these processes in ensuring project success and customer satisfaction. The definition of internal audits has evolved, shifting towards a more constructive and improvement-oriented approach. We will explore the role of auditors as consultants who provide valuable insights. Audits can help increase the likelihood of success, detect issues early on, and prevent legal problems. They also contribute to organizational learning and knowledge building. 
We will discuss different types of project audits, including progress, process, product, and contractor audits. Audits can occur at different points in a project's lifecycle and may be mandatory based on corporate or regulatory requirements. Internal auditors must possess strong social skills and understand technical and administrative aspects of projects. They need to objectively assess situations and provide constructive feedback.
The video module will cover the auditing process's various phases, emphasizing both routine and non-routine audits. We will delve into establishing baselines, assessing performance against them, and analyzing project variances. The significance of policies, procedures, and contracts in audits will be highlighted. We will focus on conducting efficient audits using resources and past experiences.
The instructor will discuss the importance of clear, constructive feedback in audit reports and how to design reports for different audiences. Recommendations for improvement and the significance of discussing audit findings with stakeholders will also be addressed. The module will highlight the importance of open communication and addressing different perceptions during these discussions.
We will learn about the termination of audits and the recording of lessons learned for future reference. The instructor will stress the importance of critical decision-making throughout the audit life cycle, including adaptability in facing new challenges. The module will cover both internal and external audits, exploring their advantages and drawbacks.
The instructor will discuss the semantic differences between using the terms ""audit"" and ""review"" and suggest the use of ""review"" for a more positive perception. Different types of audits in the project environment and their purposes, such as evaluating performance variables and improving project practices, will be explored.
The video module will also cover common audit points in the project lifecycle and the closure of projects. Topics such as seeking acceptance from the customer, resource shutdown, team member reassignment, account closure, formal delivery process creation, and final project reports will be addressed.
The module will conclude by informing students that they will delve into more advanced and cutting-edge topics in project management in the remaining modules. Overall, the video module for ENMA 604 will equip students with a comprehensive understanding of project reviews, audits, and closure, providing them with valuable insights and skills for their future careers in project management.; Transcript: Hi and welcome to module 21. This learning module is where we actually closed the project. But before we do that, we need to understand that we have certain processes or methods that help us to check if everything is okay. So we're going to talk about project reviews and project audits and we're going to talk about project closure. So at this point we have already gone through the planning. We have executed the activities and control the performance of the project, and we are now focusing on doing the project reviews or checkpoints that or implementing some checks through different checkpoints that we will have through the project life cycle. And of course the most important checkpoint is at the end of the project before we close the project and hand the deliverables to the customer. So and let's look at the presentation and see what, what we what is what we're going to be talking about project audits. We will talk about the audit life cycle, the different types of audits and project closure. So what is a project audit? The Institute of Internal Auditing changed about ten years ago. The definition of what is an internal audit and that definition was moved now into a more positive definition in which we are not hunting witches. We are not looking for to focus on the people. Where we're looking is to try to generate an environment that. Plot in which. Important facts are identified that can help the organization to do better. Continuously.

So in other words. Auditors are beginning to be seen less than the police and more like consultants that you can actually call at any point of time to help you understand what is a that you are doing right or wrong and help us help you or help the organization to improve. And so there are different aspects of of the internal audit function that we need to embrace in the project environment because they can help you to, as a project manager, to do better, to do better, and to be sure that what you're doing is is being done in the right way. There are many benefits. Of course. This assurance that you are getting through an audit will help you to increase the probability that things will go right and that you are able to catch anything that is going wrong at the right time so that you can address it. And usually auditors focus a lot on the legal repercussions of some of the tasks, so they may be able to avoid some lawsuits and some legal problems between the team and and the customer or or some regulatory agencies. In the end, having an internal audit function will help the organization to build a body of knowledge on the different risks, different situations that can be addressed, and auditors can be seen as as being a knowledge brokers, moving knowledge across the organization. So in the end it can lead to actually generate an organizational learning capability that can impact, and we all know that will impact the performance of the organization.

So how do we organize or how do we include that internal auditing function in an organization? So you may have, as we have the engineering line managers or departments within a matrix organization, you may have an auditing department in which you have an auditing manager that assign work to auditors into each of these projects. The auditors may or may not belong to the team, depending on the size of the project. It's a small project probably. You have auditors going in and out and for a few hours and just to do the audit. But if you have a very large project. That has a lot of areas that need to be checked. You may have an auditor totally assigned full time to that project. Highlighters can be also completely independent. They may not belong to the organization structure. They may be outside the organization and just reports straight to the manager and which again has some pros and cons. One pro is that they meet. They may be totally independent than when they they belong to the same organizational structure, but they may have the issue of being too away from what is really happening and not being so objective or looking more into the numbers or not why things actually happen. Another important thing is that the internal auditors may have more than one boss. And actually, this is a good thing because it forced them to be totally objective with what is going on.

What I'm showing on the screen is when you have a large corporation in which you have an internal auditing function reporting to the general manager, but also reporting to a corporate audit auditing function. And actually I lived this situation in which we found a problem within the manufacturing section of an organization, and we had to report this to both to the general manager and to the corporate auditing manager. And what we. Found was that the general manager didn't like the results. And if these results were communicated to the corporate office, he was going to be in trouble. So he persuaded the general auditing the auditing manager that he delay that report and not being sent immediately to the corporate auditing manager so that he had time to actually fix the situation. He actually suggested many times that he wanted to he wanted that Oz, do not send that report to corporate auditing. So which is not a good thing. And we had to be politically correct and say, well, we can't delay, but we can not keep it. To us. It needs to be something that that needs to be go up. Remember, we had two bosses and any of these two at any point of time can immediately affect the team, can make changes that can make us completely disappear or fire people if it was necessary. So we had to please two different bosses, which again keeps things very objective.

So in the end, it was good because even though we show a bad thing that happened, we were able to actually show that that corrective actions were taken, which in the end is what is important. We are not trying to focus on the people. We're trying to focus on the problem to try to solve it and move forward. Project actors, as I said, act as knowledge brokers that move around. They are all the time checking projects, checking different aspects of the of the organization. And when they do that, they gain knowledge. So when they come to you, they might be already seeing similar situations like the one that you're having and may have the solution in the in the. In their heads just in no time. So we need to see them as consultants because that is how they actually act nowadays. And you can get in trouble, of course, with an auditor, but usually it is not the first time unless you have done something extremely bad. But usually organizations are flexible. It was not in your hands. The other thing is that they need to have a really good set of social skills. Communication is critical because you need to find out you are pretty much. Are a internal investigator looking to try to find facts. You act sometimes as a. As a detective. Sometimes you act as a as. Journalist trying to figure out trying to gain the facts, to come up with the conclusion of what's going on.

So. They need to have a lot of soft skills like negotiation skills, conflict resolution skills, teamwork skills. Sometimes you need to be social a lot of times. And when we got training in in internal auditing, we got a. We got encouraged that we had to socialize with people because during socialization is when you actually begin to know more about what's going on in the field. So many times we actually had conversations. Dinner or drinks after normal hours just to find out that someone comes to us and say, you know, what's going on? Here's what's happening in this side and the other side. So we were encouraged to do that because it was part of our job. And we need to understand both sides of of a project and of a of an organization. We need to understand the technical side. And we had to understand the administrative side of everything to measure the impact of things going wrong or going. Okay. In this job that I had, I was brought as an engineer to this auditing team in which everybody was actually an accountant. So and the whole idea to build that intelligence auditing team was because in that company that I used to work for, they had a really good cutting edge technology that accountants didn't understand the basics to be able to have a very objective audit. So whenever they had to go and and interview people, whatever they say, they thought that it was okay.

And that's what they wrote in the report just to find out later that things actually were going really bad and that all the auditing reports that they generated were not good. We're not valid. So when they brought me and my boss, both engineers and this team. We were able to go and have really good discussions at both levels, technical and administrative levels, and pretty much no one could lie to us. And we had the facts, the truth in front of us, and we were able to really come up with really good early reports and solutions to those problems. There are different types of project audits. One is the progress audit in which pretty much we are reporting status. Usually it's cost and schedule may be how well we are meeting the quality attributes of the deliverables, the expectations. That's another thing that we could do. The other one is process audit, in which we are reviewing the practices that are being used and the technologies. Remember that sometimes we talk about technology as being hardware and software. So we may say that we're talking about practices or soft technology and hardware or. High technology that are being used in a given project at a given time. We can also look at the products and deliverables and check the timeline of those deliverables. Also check at the level at which these quality attributes are being met by the project. To all their ones. The contractor audit in which we focus on doing progress, process and product versus the contract that we set up with the contractor.

And finally, the general audit in which we have progress, process and product with respect to the project, plus a contracted out going on so different levels of audits that that we can have and of course different level of capabilities that we need to have in place in order for us to do this audit. When? Actually. When? Audits take place depends on many different aspects of the project. If the project is a new project with new technology going on in a very on. Unpredictable environment we may like to have. It's being programmed in a more frequent. Frequent way and. Usually we call athletes at the end of milestones to see how well the project is. Are meeting the quality of the deliverables. But also we would like to see if the project has enough resources as to be accepted and approved to continue to move forward. That's what we call having a checkpoint in which we are checking if we have enough capabilities to complete the remaining task. At that point of time. We may also do audit when things out of a sudden goes wrong. So you may call an auditor to try to check what's going on. Why are we having this spike in the cost or why things are so delayed? They may help you to figure out what's going on and come up with a solution. Another important one for those projects that last many years, sometimes decades, we're talking about in, for example, in NASA projects.

And it is important that when you are brought on board, that you request an audit so that you really understand where is where you are getting into. And that's the worst thing that you that you can do is to get into a project that was having problems and don't have an objective look at the the performance and capabilities of that project when you took over. Why? Because it may be a project that it cannot be safe. And guess what? You are the project manager and you are prepared. Remember the definition. What is a project has a single person responsible for the project and that's the project manager. So and so whenever you take a project management position from another person, immediately request an audit. That's my best advice from the time that that I actually did the auditing and, and have been involved in the project environment. And finally there are some mandatory periods that come as corporate offices maybe come out of the regulatory agencies that request some of these checkups. And we had policies in that company that I work for and they mandate when particular audits had to be done, everything was secret because they will know that you are coming and therefore they will be doing things right for a few months before you go. And then after you left, they will go and get lousy again. And so everything is this.

Auditing plants are usually secret. And frequency of audits that can be routine and non routine. Routine is when you have them plan within the life cycle of your project and within the schedule of activities that need to happen within the audit function of the project environment. Or there may be non routine when things begin to smell bad. And let's say the project management office requests the auditor to do a an audit to the project manager, or when the project manager requests an audit of the project team or when a line manager requests an audit of the project. So you may have a non routine audit in which entities request the auditing function to check up if things are going as they should be. The outage goes through a life cycle. And next, I'm showing the most important questions that we need to answer and aspects of each of the phases of the Audi life cycle and the initiation phase. We look at what is needed to be added and. And it is also important to understand why. Why is this item important to be looked at? Why is this technology important to be added? So the reason behind it, and when we talk about the reason we're talking about the negative consequences that it can be, it can bring into the team, the organization and the project manager. Of course, the next question is how will it be audited? And there are different, again, types of audits. It can be progress process contractor.

It may happen frequently or non frequently and you will need to put together a team or assign a person to do this audit. And we need to understand if maybe a formal audit or an informal audit with two different outcomes. Of course, in an informal audit there is nothing written. It is just a checkpoint in which we verbally tell the group being audit or the person being audited. What we found then is baseline against what are we going to compare the performance of that group, of that project. So we have again, different baselines in the project environment. We talk about the cost baseline, the schedule baseline, the quality attributes, baselines and all that will help us to check the performance of the project. But we also have policies, procedures that we need to meet or exceed, and we have that important document that is the contract that we need to check if things are going as we agreed in that contract. Then when we perform the audit, we need to be sure that we do it as efficiently as possible, and that means using our resources as much as we can in this audit, meaning that when we need to do it and we ask ourselves how we will do it, we can look back and see if we have done similar outages in the past that can help us to pinpoint problematic areas and that can help us to recommend ideas on how to these situations can be solved and bring back to normal activities or to normal operations.

Then is the project analysis in which we really understand if there was a variance or it was not the variance going on in that project. It was a deviation from the baseline or not a deviation. And what are the implications for the project for the people, the team, the project manager and the organization if things continue at the at the rate or as they are right now? And we need to understand how that point, negative points that we may find out how we can actually bring it back to normal operations. And that's where we actually set very clear, positive feedback on here is the things that that had to be done to clear this situation. So the tone of that report that we're going to write needs to have very clear all these aspects. What is wrong, what are the implications of these things wrong? And here are a set of tasks or a set of best practices that you can use to address this situation. And another important thing is that if you found a deviation, a problem, there are rules that will request that will guide you to continue the audit process. So in other words, you may be in a situation in which it is impossible to do the audit of 100% of everything that you have. Let's think about a work breakdown structure that has a thousand different elements in it. It is impossible to do an audit of a thousand elements in a timely manner.

So ideally, what we do in in a in the auditing function is that you sample and take 10% of whatever you're going to be auditing and actually look at it to see if within that sample everything is okay. If you find you found something wrong in that sample, then you add another 10% to the sample and do the same thing. If you found another one, another deviation, then you add another 10%. Of course, if you repeat this ten times, 100%, but usually by the second or third time, we have enough evidence that there is something wrong in that function. That and that something had to be performed to correct the way in which that task is being performed. So then after we found the deviations, we write the report and the report is very critical. Remember the equation Audi M plus four plus is equal to the sign. So we would like to design a report to the senior managers and report to those that are more technically related to the problem. So you may have a summary in the report and then there is an executive summary and then the details of that executive summary towards the end. The report needs to include at least what is the. Current status of the project. What will be the future status if we continue to that to the level that we are doing right now? In other words, if we don't do anything, how we will look in the future? What is the status of the critical task? Meaning the critical activities, the milestones, the risks, the learning that needs to be generated, the agreements with the customer? Risk assessment.

How well are the risks being considered And has have. The risk change in terms of priority, in terms of severity. Another important and this is probably I will say one of the most important elements of that report is the assumptions. Remember that I said that we are not able to do 100% auditing. Well, there are some assumptions here, so we assume certain. Uh, certain. The parameters. When we set up the audit, for example, we took only 10% of the audit. We look only at the results coming out of a certain batch of a production process. We may we only talk to a certain group of people, not to everybody. So we need to provide a very clearly in that report that this is these are the assumptions that that we took when we made the the the audit and therefore, our conclusions and recommendations are dependent on these assumptions. And finally, the recommendations. Again, the major reason why we have the auditing function is to provide feedback on how we can do better. The next thing is the report discussion of validation, critical step or phase in the audit life cycle. It is when we bring everybody related to the problem that we found and communicate to them what we found and they have the opportunity to talk about what they think about the findings.

And I was in many audits in which when we have the discussion, they said, Yeah, it is right. Things are going wrong. Help us to do better. We had other meetings in which they say, Well, forget about it. This is not as bad as you are putting there. So let's talk about these assumptions because guess what? You forgot about this, You forgot about that. And when we actually went back and looked at the new assumptions or new limitations that were given to us in that discussion, in reality, things were not that bad. And and of course, we have in the end, those that say, no, we are doing better when reality things are really worst than when you can actually find it. So this point in this discussion is the semantic that we use are critical. We never call that you made a mistake or that you make an error that that you are not doing things right. We always try to use soft words like this is a deviation from what we were looking for and a variation that we don't want to have so that we have a positive conversation that is constructive of the truth and the and and the real evidence that you are using to support your claims. Finally, you terminate the audit and you send that report to your bosses. Usually includes the the ones involved, plus the senior management and the corporate auditors.

And you stop the audit, you release the resources record lessons learned that happened during the audit and put all that together in a folder and put it somewhere so that next time that a similar audit is going to take place, you have a folder or a box in which you can go and look at it and try to gain lessons for the new audit. So critical decisions that we made through the audit life cycle includes this is formal and informal audits. As I said, informants are really good because it brings down the the emotional level and people are more willing to to tell you what things are going on. And because they know that you will help them. Next one is external virtual, internal. Again, the importance of internal. You are more close, but you may be more biased. You understand better the process, but again, that might bring bias into the audit. External will be costly because you will need to pay a consultant company and they may come totally out of the blue and may not know exactly what's going on and take longer to figure out. But these are perceived as more or less biased and more reliable. Timing. When do we want to do it? Frequency How often do we want to do them and what is the cost of having an additive function versus the benefits? So that's something that every organization needs to debate. And and who will receive the audit results when the audit has been completed? When we talk about athletes, I don't know what is about that word, but immediately brings that negative connotation.

Everybody immediately set up their defenses towards anyone doing an audit. But what about if we change the word audit and and call it now a review? So it will change immediately the tone. So I'm going to do a project review versus I'm going to do a project audit. So I would like you to think about immediately. If someone tells tells you I'm going to perform an audit of your learning process through this learning module versus someone that will tell you, I would perform a project review of your learning during this learning module. So immediately you get this different perception of what is going to happen and because of the semantics. So in the project environment, usually project audits are called project reviews, even though we have external auditors that come and do project reviews to projects and organizations, we still call them as project reviews. A really good research at NASA shows that there are different types of audits that exist and at least in the Kennedy Space Center. So. These include external audits at the program level. Internal audits at the program level. An audit that includes the project with the management of the project. So two different things, so the technical and the and the management. And also audits internal to project teams. So remember that program program is a long is is a bigger framework that includes many different projects within.

So when we talk about program audits, we're talking about audits of many projects at the same time. But when we talk about audits at the team level, we are talking about a single team that we're going to be looking at different levels. We may be looking just at the status of important. Important variables. Performance variables. Capability. Capabilities. Or we may also talking about status plus control. So what are the things that we're doing to control these important variables? They improve of current project practices. In other words, looking at how we can learn on how we can do better and if they are using the right processes or not, and how these processes can actually the new ones can actually be broadcast to the whole organization as being the new ways of doing something. And as a consequence, next slide. These include the next bullet. We are enhancing the organization Body of Knowledge. Different domains. Only project management topics can be reviewed. Only systems, engineering or technical topics are reviewed. Or we can do both project management and system engineering together to really get a more feeling of what's going on. And again, different types can be combined with different levels and can be combined with different domains. So we have here four plus four plus three. We're talking about 11 different elements. So it will be four times four, 16 plus three. We'll be talking about a really good amount of combination of different project reviews that can happen.

In a chart.

In the project environment, how can we identify when actually audits or reviews may happen and what type of those may be? So we see here again a standard project lifecycle going from conceptualization planning, execution and control and closure and where some of the most common audits actually happen after we define the concept and define what is what we need to do, the we collect the requirements for the customer, we may have a project design review before we move into actually planning to generate that product. So then we before we move into the planning, we have a project proposal review in which we are proposing how we will meet the requirements of that project if it is approved. And here's what you may have a competition with different people sending different proposals on how they can actually do the project, a bidding process. Then the one that is accepted move and move into the planning. It gets more funds and then ended up building that plan on how they will meet the project requirements. At the end of that planning, you have a project plan review. Some people call it murder boards, which the project manager stand up and tell us how things are going to happen and and other project managers on purpose plays what is called the devil's advocate. And they try to shoot down that project on purpose. But that's the objective of the exercise, to figure out if the project manager has everything covered and if and if not, how he can actually do it better by recommendation of the other project managers. And then when you get into the execution phase, we're talking about milestones, reviews that can happen at the end of different phases of the project to check if everything is going as it was supposed to.

And then before it gets into the closure phase, we have what is called a pre customer review in which the customer may look at what we are about to deliver and may suggest some changes. And before we move into the closure and finally in the closure is when we hand that final product to the customer. The final service to the customer. And we would like to have a customer review in which they sign off that everything is as they expected or not. And and then we close the project. So when we talk about closing projects. There are different reasons why we close it. One is normal. The project went through a life cycle and and everything happened as expected. Premature is when maybe we run out of money or we may have some issues that make us to close the project early. We may have failed projects that had to be shut down at any point of time, or we may need to look at the projects that are not anymore viable to be producing organization or support by the organization because of a change in the priorities. Because again, this project is not anymore critical to the organization. You may also have projects that are it seems like they are there forever and you just need to close them down again because of. They've been out for quite so long that whatever they're going to produce is not any more needed. So we need to close those projects. So when we close projects, what we do.

First thing is.

Seek acceptance from the customer of the deliverables. Try to gauge if they are satisfied or not. Try to see if it is if you can bring them to a happy closure of the activities. Next thing that you shut down the resources and releases of new resources, meaning that you are not spending more money, you are not contracting more people. And. If you are in a project based organization, you begin to reassign members of the team to other to other projects, or you just simply release them and say, okay, you go and and do something else. This project is over. You begin to close all the accounts that you have and check that all the bills have been paid and you make sure that there is a formal delivery process to the customer. Again, with the sign off and you build the final report, whatever it is, one page or a ten page or a 100 page, but a final report in which we put all the material that was used, the plan and everything that we produced in that project and create that or stock that project folder with all the information and make sure that you label very well and that everybody can access after the project is over.

So with this I am completing this module number 21. Aadhaar covers an important aspect of the project, which is the project reviews. Our project audits depend how we call it. If it's internal or external, depending on the semantics that we would like to use. And and also we talk about project closure in which we bring that project to a happy and happy end, hopefully. And with this again, I'm completing this learning module and I'm moving to a learning module number 22. So as you have seen, we are making progress in terms of covering the critical material of this course. So from this point on, the materials that we're going to cover are additional to what normally is covered in a project management course. And the materials that we are bringing are more cutting edge from this point on, more advanced project management. Up to now it has been all basic project management techniques, also basic human techniques related to project management. And now we're going to move into more advanced domains that are important to be recognized in project management. We can call them more cutting edge or modern topics in project management. So look forward to talk to you in module 22.",6800,"[ 0.00672556 -0.01493672 -0.00437279 ... -0.00131503  0.0100228

Project Quality,23.0,PM,"Title: Project Quality; Description: Welcome to module 23 on Project Quality. This module is crucial for understanding the importance of quality throughout the project life cycle. Project quality is no longer something we should put a lot of effort into because it should be ingrained in our business practices. In today's competitive environment, quality is a necessity for survival. We cannot afford to provide subpar products and services as customers have a wide range of options. It is important to note that companies that publicly announce their investment in quality programs often see a decline in their stock prices, as investors may perceive this as a red flag. Thus, quality should be a fundamental part of our organizational philosophy without excessive advertising. 
In this module, we will discuss the philosophy of quality, quality in the project environment, and managing quality from different perspectives. We will explore the cost of quality, different types of quality in the project environment, and their implications. Quality is often defined as the degree of excellence or the totality of features that satisfy customer needs. Quality attributes are measurable characteristics that help gauge customer satisfaction, such as storage capacity, speed, and color for products or accuracy, delivery format, and language usage for services. 
The philosophy of quality management, stemming from Deming and other quality movements, emphasizes customer satisfaction and empirical process control using data analysis to continuously improve performance. In the project environment, quality management ensures that the project satisfies the needs for which it was undertaken. This involves considering various stakeholders and their requirements throughout the project lifecycle. The project perspective focuses on quality conformance and quality of design, while the customer perspective considers price, expectation management, and conformance. 
Quality planning is essential in determining the quality attributes of deliverables and how the project will meet them. It involves scope management, such as creating a work breakdown structure, to align project objectives with customer requirements. Quality control ensures that the project meets the set standards and involves methods like control charts, parallel diagrams, and project reviews to monitor and fix deviations. Verification and validation are performed to check the accuracy of deliverables. Quality assurance ensures the use of appropriate techniques and involves audits of quality processes and final products. 
The cost of quality includes prevention, detection, internal correction, satisfaction, and measurement test costs. Preventive measures help avoid defects, while detection ensures conformance to quality standards. Internal correction aims to fix issues before customer delivery, enhancing cost-effectiveness. Satisfaction and measurement test costs should also be considered. Preventing quality issues is crucial and can reduce the need for other cost categories. A cost-benefit analysis should be conducted to determine the best approach. 
In conclusion, this module highlights the need to focus on producing high-quality products and services in projects. Quality should be integrated into our organizational philosophy, with checks and balances throughout the project life cycle to ensure customer satisfaction. By prioritizing prevention and continuously improving processes, we reduce the costs associated with quality issues. Remember to prioritize customer satisfaction and strive for the highest quality in all your projects.; Transcript: Hi and welcome to module 23 Project Quality. This is a very important module that we need to keep in our mind as we move through the life cycle of a project. Project quality nowadays needs to be a given. We should not. Make that much effort in doing project quality because we are supposed to be doing it as our way of business. There is this said this a proposition that a few authors have put out with respect to project quality and to respect to the quality function in organizations that say that you cannot we cannot live nowadays without it. So in order for us to compete in the environment, that is part of what we need to provide to our customers. That is, if we are in a very competitive environment. So if we are the sole providers of some services or products, we have seen that the companies in those specific circumstances have get used to it and then lower their quality level. And we are paying more for pretty much a garbage products. So but now that we have this open competition and globalization, pretty much there is no way in which we can compete and survive in the environment without having quality as the underlying philosophy of the organization. Actually, there is a suggestion that said that when companies communicate that they are investing in their quality of their products and processes, there have been a decline of their stock prices in the stock market, the stock market.

So just imagine that, how the immediately the investor will perceive a company broadcasting or sharing with the public that they are trying to enhance their quality programs and by doing that pretty much are raising a red flag that maybe something is going on in the company. And again, because it is the way in which we need to be conducting business today, we shouldn't be putting too much effort and advertising that so much is just how we need to operate. It's part of our philosophy of doing things in in companies in these days. So let's look at the presentation of this very short learning module, but a very important one. So we'll talk about the philosophy of quality and quality in the project environment and what are the perspectives that we need to consider in managing quality. We will talk about the cost of quality. We will talk about the different types of quality that we would like to consider in the project environment and some implications to a project. So what is really quality? This is a very fuzzy and soft concept, but this is what we can find outside. Someone said that it's the degree of excellence of a thing. Another definition said that the totality of the features that satisfy some needs. So you may have your own definition. What is quality for you? What does it means that you're going to get a quality product or a quality service when you go to a restaurant.

So think about that with respect to quality. There are certain things that certain characteristics that we can actually observe and measure to know if we are really meeting or not, the expectations of the customer. The quality attributes are, as I said, things that we can observe and hopefully things that we can actually measure to know how well we're doing or what is what the customer actually expect expected from us. For example, in a personal computer, which is a product, we may be talking about the capacity of storage, the speed, the colour of the case. If we are talking about a service, let's assume as an example, a consulting firm report out of an investigation that was performed. We're talking about accuracy and validity of the results, the delivery delivery format. If it is going to be a hard copy or a soft copy, the technical language use of the national language used in the report and the timing of the delivery. So even though it is a soft deliverable, it's a service. We can identify attributes of that service that can help us to measure the extent to which we are meeting or not the customer expectations. So quality attributes are those. Identifiables or observables, things that we can actually measure and and and hopefully measure and keep track of it to know how well we're doing in terms of quality.

So the philosophy of quality comes out of Deming and then Duran and all these quality movements that made it one of the most important things that happened in the, uh, in, in the world during a good period of time. Then it evolves in different areas, like, for example, the Six Sigma, which is again an extension of total quality management, statistical process control, which is considered within a total quality management. So there are many programs that actually have been founded or supported by seeing quality as a philosophy in organizations. So in that philosophy, the first thing is customer satisfaction. People is, is is always put first before technology and before money. And uh, there is this focus on what is called an empirical process control, which is using data to come up with information about what's going on and an analysis that will help us to continuously improve our performance and capabilities. So in general, that's what the the philosophy of quality management puts forth with respect to the project environment. Quality management has been defined by the project management book of the Project Management Institute as the process that requires to ensure that the project will satisfy the needs for which it was undertaken. So the needs comes out of the stakeholders, the key stakeholders, the customer that set up the major requirements. But also we have some other stakeholders that are important to monitor and to manage so that we satisfy them through the project lifecycle, not at the end of the project lifecycle.

Only when we talk about project quality, we need to take a look at the two different perspectives what is what we can give the customer, what is, what we can offer, which is the project perspective and what is what the customer needs or what is the customer perspective. We talk about quality of conformance to the customer needs and we call about quality of design. When we talk about the customer defining what is what they or he or she or they want with respect to the project perspective, we're talking about quality attributes being the cost of the quality and the timeline to deliver some quality products With respect to the attributes for the customer. We're talking about the price and we're talking about the expectations of those attributes during and after the project is completed. Some basics. Quality management processes includes quality planning, quality control and quality assurance. Quality planning. Answer these questions. What are the quality attributes of the deliverables? Of course, we get those from the requirements that the customer set in the contract or during that conversation that we had in the beginning of the project. How is the project going to meet them? So how are we making sure that we are going to produce those quality attributes that are needed by the customer? And of course, here's when we do a scope management which includes the state statement of work and most importantly in our environment is the work breakdown structure in which we are making sure that we have the elements that will meet the objective for the project and as a consequence, meet the requirements set by the customer, which includes of course, the quality attributes of that final product or service that they would like to have.

With respect to quality control we're talking about. How we are making sure that the project is meeting those quality standards of quality attributes that we set up in the quantity quality planning phase. And if the project is not meeting those standards, then how can we fix the project? How can we change the things that we're doing? And if it is doing that, I mean meeting the quality standards, the quality attributes, how can we stay on target and and be sure that we don't have any deviation in the future? There are different tools and techniques that we use to do this, which include control charts in which we plot by time, for example, the thickness of a of an aluminum can as it's being produced in the factory. Or we do parallel diagrams in which we make sure that we focus on the most important items that provides more variability to the process, or we perform a more human technique, which is the start.

Stop, continue, continue. What is what we need to start doing? What is what we need to stop doing? What is what we need to continue doing to meet the quality attributes set up by the customer. We also can perform project reviews that, as we saw in the previous learning modules that can help us to check if things are on track and and how well the project is doing in terms of performance and and capability and with respect to performance, technical performance and human performance. And again, the other thing is verification and validation of everything that has been produced so far. Just checking that everything is supposed to it is being done as it was supposed to be done. And we are producing products and services at the level that we were supposed to. With respect to quality assurance, we talk about making sure that we are using the right techniques and to produce the expected deliverables. Pretty much what we're talking about here is doing audits of the quality processes and techniques that we are using and also auditing the final product and a and some preliminary results that we may have. So here is where actually quality brings together the project reviews and the project audits as a one action that can be performed through the project life cycle. With respect to the cost. There are different costs that quality bring into a project or into an organization.

The first one is the cost of prevention. How can we prevent defects to occur or how can we avoid that something goes wrong in building this product or delivering this service. And the other cost is the cost of detection. How can we assure that we are producing the service or generating the deliverables at the quality level that is expected by the customer? So we need to have some detection capability that is going to help us to review to ensure ensure conformance to those requirements. Cause of internal correction. If we found something wrong. Uh, before we submit that deliverable to the customer or before we actually provide that service to the customer, how can we correct that? So any cost that we incur after something has been produced to refine it, to to revise it, to actually change it so that it conforms to the expectations of the customer. We call that cost of internal correction. And if it happens within the factory, within the organization, within the project, it is less costly than if it happens after we have already delivered to the customer. Because at that point the customer will we have all the logistical issues of actually fixing it in the customer company or when it's with the customer. But we also have that cause of the lack of satisfaction that may come out of the customer because of that. And that can be translated in losing future projects because of that issue.

Finally, the cost of measurement test. Some organizations have equipments, laboratories, tools that help them to keep track of their processes and products and and those labs and the people in the lab have some cost. So when we talk about the measuring, we need to be sure that we understand that it comes with a price tag to the organization. So when we put all these costs together, that is what we call the the cost of having quality product in a project or in an organization. Of course we need to do a cost benefit benefit analysis. So which one of these do we really want to? Produce or which one of these can we really eliminate to achieve the level of satisfaction that we want in the customer? So of course, we can see that if something goes wrong and we need to change it, we need to change it. So three and four, there is pretty much no way around unless we scrap that and we produce a new one which can be also seen as a cost of correction. The cause of detection in which we review. We may also say, well, we can trust our production process, we can trust our people, and we cannot do it. The cost of measurement tests. We can eliminate totally a quality lab by trusting our suppliers and trusting our production line. Or trusting our people.

But in the first.

One, the cost of prevention is the one that we need to always work on, because this is the one that if we do a really good job here, we don't need the other ones. So trying to prevent quality issues since day one, making sure that we have a good process, making sure that we check that we are doing the right things, may eliminate or reduce the cost of the other 2 to 5. Quality cost. So with this, I'm completing, as I said, this very short learning module, just bringing into perspective that we need to focus on producing high quality products and services through our projects, that even though quality and quality nowadays is a given in in any business environment, that we need to make sure that that we are that we have some check and balances during the project life cycle to guarantee that we are operating at the highest quality level as possible so that we can please the much that we can our stakeholders, but more especially our project customer. With this again, I'm completing a learning module number 23 and I will talk to you in learning module 24.",3269,"[-0.00738182 -0.00125923 -0.0004937  ... -0.00131163 -0.00801717

Crisi Management in Projects,24.0,PM,"Title: Crisi Management in Projects; Description: Module 24 of ENMA 604 focuses on project crisis management. It introduces the concept of crisis in a project and emphasizes the need to address problems before they escalate into crises and crises before they turn into disasters. The module covers the levels of impact, time of impact, type of impact, and decision timeline that define problems, crises, and disasters. It also discusses crisis induction for training purposes and the inherent negative nature of disasters. 
The video module further explores crisis management, starting with risk management and the strategies to prevent or limit risks. It highlights the importance of identifying and reacting to crises, which can be challenging as people often fail to realize they are in a crisis until it is too late. The module covers the appointment of a crisis manager, formation of a crisis management team, and effective communication with stakeholders.
The resolution of a crisis is a crucial step, involving leading the effort, empowering the team, and implementing corrective actions based on the identified causes. Learning from the crisis is emphasized to prevent similar situations in the future. Knowledge management strategies are discussed for data collection and sharing. The role of individual perception in labeling events as problems, crises, or disasters is also explored.
Returning to normal operations is the ultimate goal, but options such as altering the project scope or requirements may be considered if attempts to address the crisis fail. The importance of learning and applying lessons from the crisis for future prevention is stressed.
Throughout the module, key topics such as risk management, crisis project management, leadership, communication, conflict resolution, teamwork, and ethics will be repeatedly discussed. The complexity and challenges associated with crisis resolution are highlighted, using the example of the oil disaster in the Gulf. The importance of effective teamwork and ethical decision-making is emphasized.
The instructor shares research findings on the effectiveness of crisis management systems in organizations of different sizes. The video module aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of crisis management and its various components. It emphasizes the importance of generating knowledge and understanding of crisis situations to prevent and effectively handle them.
The video module will also cover proactive and reactive approaches to crisis management. The proactive approach involves having a clear plan, designated crisis manager, and team ready to respond to anticipated crises. The reactive approach involves ad hoc responses without a pre-established plan or team. The importance of adopting a proactive approach for leaders to provide a sense of security is discussed.
The module includes an article on firefighting in the project environment, where specific project elements may undergo delays or crises with cascading impacts. It explores the redirection of resources and potential strategies to break the cycle of crises.
The module concludes by stating that crisis project management is a normal occurrence in research and development environments and teases the exploration of cutting-edge topics in project management in the next module.; Transcript: Hi and welcome to module 24. We are still talking about this special topics in project management, cutting edge topics that expand the basic understanding that we have provided so far in the course. So this next special topic is a project crisis management or pretty much how do we manage crisis when they happen within our project. So again, very important module, very. Soft has some techniques that are important to recognize. But in general, we will see. What what do we mean when we talk about crisis in a project? And so let's look at the presentation. So topics that we want to cover include crisis management, what it is, crisis in projects and crisis management in projects. We need to recognize what is a crisis, what is a problem it to understand the steps to do crisis management. And understand the human side of. Crisis management and different strategies. So what is a crisis? It's a situation. And that situation happens with or without knowledge or warning that it was coming. Some people have said that if we really know the crisis, we are able to figure out how the crisis begins to be put together. But usually when we recognize that there is a crisis, all these indicators are just again, all these variables are already combined. And and they indicators, single indicators won't give you much information about the crisis until it's just too late. So crisis is a situation that happens with or without knowledge or warning that threatens the capabilities, performance and reputation of a given organization, group or individual.

And and that's what really makes it important to anyone involved. So in order to solve that situation requires the attention of several stakeholders, the organization, someone responsible for it for for each resolution and. So. Finally, this situation requires diversion of resources into it so that it can be resolved. So the situation that happens with or without knowledge threatens capabilities, performance and reputation. Sometimes people's lives, too. That requires attention. And that requires that we divert resources so that it can be resolved and bring us back to normal operations. So when we talk about escalation in problems, we see how issues or problems become crises and crises can become disasters. So if we don't take care of a problem, a problem can grow into a crisis. And if we don't take care of a crisis, a crisis can become a disaster. Well, while we are dealing with a crisis, a crisis may generate new problems out of the crisis. So, in other words, we may be leading with this A. Very difficult situation. But that situation may be impacting some other areas of the organization and some other areas of the individuals and creating problems somewhere else. And again, if it escalates, generates a disaster. And as I said before, a disaster might generate different crises at different points of times at different levels of the organization and can also generate problems someplace else.

So everything is very is interrelated. The key point here is to try to take care of the problems before they can grow into crisis and try to take care of crisis before they can become disasters. How can we define them? Problem, crisis and disaster. So let's look at the level of impact that let's let's look. Let's look at the time of impact, the type of impact and the decision timeline. So three important things that are important to define for each of these problem, crisis or disaster. With respect with respect to problems, we define that the level of impact of a problem is limited. It has some impact upon some areas of of the project management system, maybe a few stakeholders or few items or elements of your work breakdown structure. And we say that the type of impact that can have upon upon the project can be positive and can be negative. And we will talk about this in the next seconds and the decision timeline to try to resolve the problem is flexible. We have room to prioritize our project management actions. In other words, we may be leading with a risk in one side or managing cost and we may have this problem and we say, okay, I can deal with this problem tomorrow or in two days. It is not that important that I deal with the problem right now.

We need to deal with it. But again, we have time that we can use to prioritize, prioritize our actions. With respect to crisis. We're talking about that the level of impact is large. It is affecting a major portion of your project. It may be half of your work of the elements of your work breakdown structure or if or if affecting the critical path of the project. So you have a major issue going on that needs to be taken care. The type of impact is again positive by negative. And the decision timeline is short. You need to take action as soon as possible because otherwise this crisis can become worst and can even reach the level of a disaster. And we'll talk about the difference between the two. But this usually these situations, if you don't take care of them, they will begin to grow and grow and pretty much eat and affect every part of the project and reach up to the organization and begins to affect the performance of the whole organization. With respect to disaster, we are talking a very large impact and extensive social impact that can be measured by loss of lives. Uh, there is another category or another level that in some crisis management literature they recommend, which is the catastrophe. And the only difference between a disaster and a catastrophe is the number of deaths that actually has happened. So in a disaster, if I'm not mistaken, is less than 2000 in catastrophe is more than 2000 people died because of it.

And again, they have there is no consistent scale on the literature of of that number. But again, it's depending on the number of deaths. So of course, the decision timeline, the disaster is just as soon as possible. Yesterday we had to solve it. So we need to divert all our resources to try to. Come back to normal operations as soon as possible. Let's now look at the type of impact. We see positive and negative? What do we mean with positive and negative? Of course, if there is a problem or a crisis or a disaster, we always think about the negative side of the situation. So a problem can bring me to spend more time just. By definition, a problem is required requiring that we divert our resources, our attention, and that is by itself a negative thing that can happen to us in the project environment. However, and same thing with the crisis. However, if we are able to learn from problems and avoid them in the future, we can say that that's something positive that we can get out of a problem. With respect to crisis, how can we generate something positive out of them? So most likely everybody will say, Well, that's impossible. Everything that will happen is negative. So but let me tell you something. There are ways in which we can induce crisis without actually being in a crisis.

And for example, when we have a. Situations in which we would like that people change because of an imminent, let's say, change that is coming in the market. We have seen how leaders of organizations have actually induced crisis in organizations just to make people fear that something bad is going to happen and that they need to change so that they adapt to the new environment, new customer, new thing that is coming up. So crisis can be induced without actually being in a crisis. The other thing is, for example, when we have flight simulators or simulations in which you put trainees through situations that are not real are simulated environments and they can actually gain knowledge by being in these situations so that if they face similar situation in the future, they know or they have developed the skills needed to face or to try to resolve or to try to address this situation. So from crisis, yes, we can get positive impact when we use it to develop knowledge and develop coordination strategies. And for example, when when there are drills, fire drills in companies, that is pretty much a simulated crisis to see how well we respond and where are our our capability gaps that we need to fill so that we are better prepared if something happened next, next, next year or next time that we do something, we do something similar.

With respect to disaster, even though we can say that we can learn out of them because of the impact upon people's life, we always say that it's negative. There is no way in which we can induce a disaster to learn from it. And we're going to sacrifice people's life just to gain knowledge. So we define that as being always negative. So in terms of crisis management, what are the steps that we need to follow in in the management of of of this very demanding situation? So the first thing that we need to do in crisis management is to prevent a crisis for happening, and that is what we call risk management. So in risk management, we identify risk and we try to set up strategies to try to limit the probability that they happen or limited the impact if they materialize. Sometimes we completely give the risk to another entity so we can transfer or we can share it, but sometimes we just don't do anything or sometimes we just can't understand what can go wrong in the future. And so we did not have enough knowledge as to prevent a crisis for happening. So we couldn't do risk management because we just simply could not identify any risk. So in our eyes, everything was good and we may even be planning for some of the risk, but we didn't plan for this particular one that grew and became a crisis.

So. Next step is we need to identify and react to the crisis. Two steps in there. We need to identify the crisis. It's very difficult to do it because usually when people are so involved in the process, they don't realize they are in a crisis until it's too late. And sometimes they cannot revert their actions and go back and very quickly on track. For example, the problem that happened in the oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, it actually very quickly turned out to be deadly. And and it was a situation that could not be resolved that easily after it started. So we need to react to the crisis. And reaction means that we need to do at least three things. First. We need to assign a crisis manager who is going to be leading the effort of bringing back this project, this organization, back to normal operations. Second thing, we need to build a crisis management team of highly motivated and and capable individuals that most likely are going to be working over time and and doing a very tough job that not everybody is able to do. And and finally, is communication. Communication is so critical during a crisis because you need to face your stakeholders and let them know what is going on. There is a humongous amount of cases in which the literature chronicle that when leaders try to mask a crisis, it actually backfires so badly.

That usually ended up either in the organization having to pay a lot of money or that leader getting fired. So. So. Best thing that you can do is face the public, face those stakeholders involved, and just let them know what's going on and how you are trying to fix it. Of course, you need to let them know too. What is the implication of that crisis upon the performance and how they are going to be affected by the by the crisis? Next thing, of course, that you need to do is to resolve the crisis, lead the effort, lead the team, bring the stakeholders that you need so that the situation is being back to normal operations as soon as possible. By any day that happens without being in normal operations, there is a humongous amount of cost involved and the cost is not only the cost of the investment in bringing the situation back to to normal operations, but also what you were supposed to be doing if you were in normal operations at that day. So so we need to divert resources. We need to empower the team and we need to figure out what are the causes and how can we come up with corrective actions. We remember the oil rig in the Gulf. They tried with several plants and some of those failed before they actually reached the plant that really bring that oil well to a completely stop.

I mean, the leak to a whole stop. Finally, it is all about learning. So if we go through this process of resolving a crisis, identifying the crisis or preventing a crisis without learning, we are again setting up setting up ourselves to have a similar situation happening in the future without knowing how to deal with it. So learning needs to happen at, during and after the crisis. During the crisis, it's very difficult because you have all these team dedicated to try to resolve the crisis. But here is where knowledge management strategies or methods are really good because you can assign a group of knowledge managers that will be collecting data during that crisis so that the the people that is supposed to be resolving the crisis do not get diverted from their task to try to do knowledge management. So you can assign people to actually do it for them and get all that knowledge and share it later on. And most importantly, step five, we need to apply that learning. Go back to preventing a crisis. See if we miss something that could help us to identify that risk and then make sure that everybody understand that from that point on so that everybody accounts for that risk and prevent similar situations from happening in the future. So if we had to put it in a in a chart, it would look something like this. So we have an event and that event has a perception by the key stakeholders.

In this case, project manager for that perception is impacted by the individual aspects of the stakeholder, the context in which that event is happening and the content or the event itself and the implications. So let's say that we are a project manager that has never faced any type of of crisis situation. So my individual capabilities will immediately raise a red flag if something goes bad very quickly. So. If my context is a constant, a constant context in which things are happening very fast and and that the type of of task that that I am performing are very critical for the organization, let's say. So my project is one of of of of those that have a lot of visibility up into the senior management level. So I am at this point, let's say, an individual with not much experience in managing crisis, managing a project that has high visibility in the organization and a project that is highly complex in terms of content. So if something out of a sudden goes wrong, I may perceive that event as a crisis. And again, I just want to highlight here the word perception because. A given event. A situation may be perceived by a person as a crisis and by other persons as a simple problem or by another person by a disaster. So I had a PhD student that did a research on me that looked at the process of certification that Air Force Wings goes through, and they are actually put into crisis management centers and they are asked to manage certain crises during exercise and during the certification process.

And what he found in his research was that even though there were similar scenarios, crisis scenarios that were induced to some of these Air Force, Air Force winds, some some of those scenarios actually have the same type of impact upon each of those teams. In other words. A given scenario was able to put a different Air Force wins in a crisis mode. But he also found that there were some some other scenarios that. Put in a crisis mode. Some Air Force winds, while it didn't actually put some other Air Force winds to reach that crisis level. In other words, what I'm saying here is that depending on the perception that an individual or a or a team or an organization has with respect to that event that is happening. They may label that event as a problem. They may label that event as a crisis or they may label that event is a disaster. And and that will depend upon, again, their perception of their capabilities to deal with that event or not. If they don't feel confident that they can deal with it, of course, immediately it's a trigger that that there is a problem. And and they will feel this is a crisis.

So moving down into that path, the next definition is that we need to execute the actions to solve this problem. The problem is a crisis, the crisis. And there is a disaster, the disaster. And if it is not a crisis problem or a disaster, we go back to normal operations. And if we were successful in addressing the problem, crisis or disaster, we need to ask the question. Are we back to normal operations? If we are, then great. If we are not, then we need to find out if we can do something different. We already try to solve the problem. Already tried to solve the crisis and solve the disaster and nothing happened. Then we need to think about if we need to change the scope of the project, we need to change the requirements, change really fundamental things of that project. If that is not possible, then probably the best option would be to shut it down. And if not, if that not is not an option, then we need to figure out that. Then going back to what are the things that we can change, that we can that can help us to go back to normal operations? Anna. If the only option is to close. The project, of course, is a closed down and all is going to lead to a normal operation. That may not be the same as we had before, but what is the most important thing? Thing that is happening at this time is that we are generating knowledge, understanding of the situation so that we can prevent it.

Or if something like this happen in the future, at least we have the ability to call those lessons learned and use it here. When I was doing a research in a company about a risk management and knowledge management, they say that they have a system that helps them to. Uh, tackle this type of crisis situations very quickly. It is based on people. Another student told me once that she didn't know that she was a crisis project manager, but that after she went through this course, she found herself as being the crisis project manager of the company. She said that whenever a program or a project was in trouble, her boss called her and request her to get in charge of that project. So the project manager was put in a different duty and she actually had to work trying to bring that project back on a normal operations. When I ask the question how she does it, she said that she relies in a very motivated and highly capable team, that they know that they're going to be working over time and working during the weekend. But that they trust each other. They perform at the same level of high performing individuals. And again, they are able to tackle this type of situations very quickly.

Here is the human side of crisis management that goes into the management of the crisis. There is also that human side of the people affected by the crisis, but we are not talking about that. We're talking about we trying to lead our or address that crisis. So we talk about leadership and how leaders need to be very charismatic. If we remember 911, we remember the people that were actually leading the pack trying to resolve that crisis. And especially I remember Mayor Giuliani actually helping coordinate all these actions with Katrina. Again, there were some other leaders trying to figure out how to resolve that situation. Next thing is communication. Communication is so critical between the leader and the stakeholders, everyone affected. There are constant updates of how things are going if we remember the disaster in the Gulf. There was a web page in which we could find easily the areas that have been affected and are communicating a clear communication line if you have any problem. And but most importantly, we could see live that video that shows how things were actually happening And when that oil rig was closed and the leaks were eliminated, we actually could see that in national television pretty much live. So, again, really good to calm down the emotions of the people by actually looking. Some other people say that by looking at that, actually the emotions went up because we couldn't believe that we spend so much time trying to fix the problem.

But let me tell you, it was a very complex problem that few of us really have. A well, many of us, I will say, have not enough understanding of the concept of variables that we're talking about at this particular. I didn't know much of the problem until very late in the process when it was very well explained by scientists on on TV. So it's a very difficult crisis to resolve. The other thing is conflict resolution. There is a lot of conflicts that are going on with respect to the oil disaster. Conflict is still going on. So a lot of people have lost their jobs. Fishermen's and the tourism is just something that will not go away that easy. Teamwork. As I said before, my students said there is no way in which you can tackle these type of situations without a very highly committed, highly motivated team. And finally, ethics. Why ethics are so important in crisis? Well, because it is so easy to cut corners to try to find out that fix that will bring everything down back onto normal operations. But let me tell you, sooner or later it will come back on and hit you. So it is very important to have ethical crisis managers in charge of this situation because, again, to some other people, moreover, to those involved in the crisis or that somehow didn't catch the crisis before it came up or somehow are responsible for those for the crisis, those are the ones that they shouldn't be put in decision making positions because, again, they may want to.

Have low ethical values so that they can avoid the bigger repercussions if things continues to go that bad. All the things that I want to share with you is a result of a research that I performed with organizations, and I asked them if they have formal or informal crisis management processes or strategies, and and to those that responded that they do have. I saw that there was kind of a tipping point in the curve. So as we see on this on the slide right now, the left side, I saw that as they report crisis management effectiveness with respect to the number of employees, as the number of employees began to grow from zero to about 100, there was a positive correlation. In other words, the higher the number of employees they hired, the effectiveness of crisis management that they reported when they have informal crisis management systems with informal crisis management system. Remember, there is nothing set up. There is no team, there is no risk management. This thing is if a crisis happens, they come together and try to fix it. And so but very interesting thing happened that after the number of employees began to grow after about 100 employees, the crisis management effectiveness, effectiveness begins to go down and there is now a negative correlation.

So the higher the number of employees in an organization using informal crisis management strategies, the lower the effectiveness reported by the organization. So. And. On the other side of the screen, we have on the right hand side, we have formal crisis management strategies and how organizations that hold or that have these type of formal crisis management strategies are not represented in the sample. If they have less than 100 employees. And you can see this because these are processes that cost money and and organizations that have less than 100 people may not have all the resources to do that. And of course, after the 100, what we saw is a positive correlation between the number of employees and the effectiveness of crisis management. So the larger the organization using formal crisis management systems or strategies, the more effective they become. So important to reflect here is that the it appears that the. When we have informal crisis management systems and our organization is relatively small or less than 100 people, somehow they figure out how to coordinate the crisis management activities to resolve the crisis. So as more people are involved in that organization doing that, most likely more people can have more knowledge and more people be able to pitch on how to resolve that crisis. And and therefore, of about 100 employees in an organization, you are able to do so if you are using an informal crisis management system.

But as you begin to have more and more people, coordination may be a big issue that will bring crisis management effectiveness now down. So and which again supports the formal crisis management results which the larger the organization and the more systems that you have to manage a crisis, the more effectiveness in managing those crisis. So again, just very interesting results that I found by doing that. The other thing is that we do proactive or reactive crisis management, proactive crisis crisis management is when we have a clear plan and some organizations have crisis management plans. When I went to my son's school when he was going to first grade, the first thing that I asked was for that plan. And they said, Yeah, we have a plan. There is a fire. If there is a tornado, if there is an earthquake, everything with respect to that, we know how to deal with. And of course, they are telling you the crisis that they have planned for, but they won't tell you if they have a plan. If someone breaks in, if someone performs some type of of of activity within the school, because those are very rare and sometimes they don't have enough resources to put plans around things that may or may not happen. So they plan for those that are more likely. And so there is usually someone that is immediately assigned as crisis manager for certain crises.

And there is a team that has been already put together that will come if a crisis of materialize. And there are resources and there are ways in which the resources can be funneled to the organization. So we are calling being proactive that we pretty much have set up a system that can support if a crisis happens. However, as I said before, we are trying to predict the future and the crisis may that is going to hit us may be completely different than the one that we plan for. And therefore it may be or maybe not likely that we have or not the capabilities needed to resolve that crisis. The other approach is the reactive approach in which there is no plan, there is no team, there is no crisis manager. And and they come together. As a group, as a team, and face the situation and try to resolve it in an ad hoc way. So not not organized way in the beginning, but they can again come together and as a group find out who's going to be leading the crisis and found out who's going to be working to resolve the crisis. When we do a proactive approach. We are pretty much protecting us. If something goes bad, say, Hey, we have a plan. But no one asked us if we actually had a plan for that specific crisis.

So the leaders of organizations will decide to go with a proactive because they want to provide that level of I call it false safety to the public or to anyone involved that there is a plan. But we all know that they may not be able to plan for every possible crisis that that can hit. And but again, as a leader, that's a responsibility that we all have to make people feel secure. And even though we know that we may be protected for, let's say, 50 out of the 100 different crises, that can actually happen. So there is this article that I provide to you in the in the course pack that talks about the firefighting in the project environment. And the course is very simple and that we need to make sure that we remember because it goes back to, let's say, having a let's talk about two different projects. We have Project A and Project B or let's talk about first about task and then we go to the project level. So let's talk about we have. A project that we are managing that has different elements in the work breakdown structure out of the Southern. One element of the work breakdown structure. Got in trouble and it is been delayed. It has a duration that we need to resolve and we don't have much capabilities to resolve it than that out of a sudden becomes a crisis.

And and that element. If we don't take care of it, it is going to affect the whole project because again, that crisis always grows and in terms of impact. So we need to be sure that we tackle that element very quickly. So to do that, we need to go and use our managerial reserve and use that reserve to fund any type of effort that will bring that element of the work breakdown structure back to normal operations. The problem is that if we begin to use our managerial reserve and we deplete that reserve, then we are faced with the. Uh, situation in which we will need to begin to use resources that we have already assigned to other activities, maybe concurrent activities or future activities, so that we actually bring that element of the work breakdown structure back to normal operations. So if we begin to bring resources, there is a level, and that's what the article talks about, that tipping point in which if we consume too much resources from other activities, then that other activity is going to immediately become a crisis activity because it doesn't have enough resources as to be produced. And guess what? Then we fix that first activity with the first crisis, and now all of a sudden we have this other activity with a different crisis because we don't have enough resources that we use to fix the first crisis. So we began to do the same thing, diverting resources from other activities to fix the second crisis.

And and this is what we call the firefighting mode. It is a closed loop cycle in which there is no way for us to get out of it. If we don't get a realistic checkpoint in which we just need to decide. To either scope down that project and eliminate some activities and then use the money or the resources that were dedicated to those activities to fix the project. Or we just need to shut down the whole project because before it's too late and the whole thing had to be go to the garbage can. So again, it's a very easy mode in which we can see how by using resources that were not assigned to do crisis management, we can actually be getting to a firefighting mode in which we use resources and puts pretty much each activity in each activity that we are drawing resources from in a crisis mode. And we can see the same thing with the projects. If we are managing a project organization and one project gets in trouble, we can use money or resources that were dedicated to another project to fix that project that is going on. But if we divert too much resources from the healthy project to the sick project, we will put the healthy project at risk and then it can get into a crisis. And then we fix the first one or kill the first one.

But we have the second one now being a crisis project. So and it's a vicious cycle that the only way to stop it, the stop it, as I said, is just to either go and gain a big amount of resources from another part of the organization or to rescope the project and use the money that would result from the rescope to solve the crisis or to shut it down and kill it early in the in the life cycle. So. With this, I am completing this very interesting learning module called Crisis Project Management and which is something that happens more often in the project environment that we can imagine. So when we don't have clear requirements set in the project, we may face ourselves later on in the project needing to divert resources from different activities so that we can actually complete certain elements of the work breakdown structure that were needed by the customer. So in the project environment and in the research and development environment specifically, crisis project management is very much a norm every day. So with this I'm completing module number 24 and look forward to talk to you in module 25, which is our last learning module. And again, it's a learning module that expand our basic understanding on project management and cover some very cutting edge topics of modern project management. So look forward to talk to you in module 25.",7163,"[-1.73622351e-02 -1.67644527e-02 -9.02650226e-03 ... -7.99636691e-05

Course Wrap up,26.0,PM,"Title: Course Wrap up; Description: Hello students! Welcome to our final module for ENMA 604, where we will be wrapping up everything we have covered this semester in project management. In this module, we will assess how well we have met our shared expectations and how our capabilities have changed throughout the course. 
Throughout the semester, we have covered a range of project management tools that have impacted your abilities to effectively manage projects. These tools include strategic tools such as SWOT analysis, value proposition and value package, and stakeholder analysis. These tools help us identify project funding needs, address weaknesses and threats, and evaluate different projects and their value propositions. 
We have also discussed economic analysis of projects, utilizing tools such as net present value, internal rate of return, and payback time. These tools help us assess the economic viability of projects. 
Additionally, we have explored a multi-criteria decision making model called the analytic hierarchy process, which allows us to evaluate and rank projects based on various criteria. 
On the topic of scope, we have covered work breakdown structure, requirement analysis, and statement of work, which help us define project objectives and provide a foundation for project planning and control. 
We have also explored tools such as activity matrix and network charts, which help us estimate activity durations and identify critical activities. 
Furthermore, we have discussed risk management tools, including the process of risk identification, evaluation, and planning, tailored to different risk preferences. 
Knowledge management, project audits, and project reviews have also been explored. These tools help us reflect on past projects, learn from them, and share knowledge across projects for continuous improvement. 
Communication management and the importance of effective communication in project environments have been emphasized as well. 
We have also covered tools for project control, such as earned value analysis, which helps us assess project performance, and resource loading chart, which helps us determine resource requirements. 
Soft skills related to human resources in project management have been a focus as well. We have discussed team formation, conflict resolution, leadership styles, and the importance of measuring both technical and human performance in projects. 
Lastly, we explored the responsibility matrix, performance appraisals, and the continuous improvement tool, Start, Stop, Continue. 
I hope this course has provided you with the knowledge and skills necessary to become better managers, engineers, and scientists in the future. Your capabilities have surely changed throughout this course, and I am confident that you will excel in your future endeavors. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. Thank you for your attention and take care!; Transcript: Hi, I'm welcome to our final Learning module module 26. This is just a quick wrap up of everything that we have done this semester for this learning course 604 project management. So let's look at the presentation. And so what we want to cover is how well did we meet our share expectations? So far, our capabilities have changed. We went through a set of project management tools through this course that have impacted your capabilities to do project management work. So if your boss comes to you and asks you, What do you know now? So these are the things that that you can tell, tell him, tell her and, and that you need to feel proud about. So with respect to strategic tools, we talk about the SWOt analysis, the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats that help us understand what are the projects that we may need to fund or the projects that we may need to put together to address weaknesses, opportunities or threats, or to make us better by strengthening our strengths. Value proposition and value package is a topic that we also talk about, and it's a tool that helps us to bring together direct benefits and indirect benefits and the cost of those of those benefits. And when we see this in the project environment, we can actually compare different projects with different value propositions and, and see how well we are doing and how well we are competing in the environment.

Stakeholder analysis is a very important topic that actually account for the people side of the project and bring into perspective how we need to make sure that we include the interests and power of certain units, certain people, certain agencies that may have a big interest or influence upon our project. Economic analysis of the project is a process that we went through when we covered the net present value, internal rate of return and payback time, and help us to actually understand how viable is our project from an economic point of view. Then we went through a multi-criteria decision making model in which the AHP, the analytic hierarchy process, actually provides us with the capability of looking at different projects or different alternatives and evaluating which one of these projects is the best, second best or third best. I'd say rank these alternatives depending on a set of criteria, and that is why we call it a multi-criteria decision making model, because we have several criteria and several projects being evaluated at the same time. Then we talk about scope, definition and how these tools call the work breakdown structure and the requirement analysis and the statement of work. Help us to define what is what we want to do and help us to set up the grounds or the foundation for a for planning a project and for controlling a project with respect to time.

Different tools that we cover includes the activity matrix in which we specify the data needed to conduct a Simpson's rule. So to estimate the duration of the duration of an activity. Remember. Optimistic plus four times most likely plus pessimistic divided by six gives you the estimated time. And we also talk about network charts and how these charts help us to determine. The duration of the project and also determine which are the critical activities that we need to pay attention to. Because if we delay any of these activities by one time unit, we are delaying delaying the whole project by one time unit. So we talk about the PDM, the presence diagramming chart that has very weird type of relationships. More realistic, we may say. But we also talk about the pair chart, which is the one that I'm expecting that you use in your course project. Then there is the probability of completion that we can calculate using the pair chart and using the standard deviation and variance of the critical path. And we talk also how to build Gantt charts and how is actually is to represent a Gantt chart and how to represent within the Gantt chart the milestones. We also did an example of how we can actually level the project based on the amount of resources that we have available and to eliminate peaks and valleys or to be more efficient in the use of our resources.

And we also talk about crashing and how we can actually invest money to buy resources so that we can speed up the duration of our project. We also went through risk management tools in which we went through the whole process, which we identify, we evaluate, and we plan for risks depending on if we are risk averse or a risk seeker type of individual or type of organization. We also talk about knowledge management in which we talk about the Project Journal in which we reflect and we look at the past, the present, so that we can learn something in the future and pass that information to other projects or to the same people within our project so that we can learn and continuously improve in our project and in the organization. We also talk about the project reviews or project audits that can help us to have checkpoints in which we look at different aspects of the project and at different levels and at different domains to see how well we are doing and share this type of knowledge across other projects so that every, every organization, every project organization becomes a continuous improvement organization, communication management. We talk about the importance of communicating the project environment and how when we lack of communication, everything else is going to be harmed. There is no teamwork, there is no coordination with the stakeholders, and then it's pretty much chaos.

We also talk about some tools that help us to control projects. We talk about net value analysis in which we have different indexes that can help us to understand in a very simple way, doing using simple mathematics. What is the performance of our project in a given point of time? And if you use those indexes to project the future performance, we are able to forecast how the project may be looking when it is over. We also talk about the guidelines to perform audits or that we also talk about this being kind of project reviews. And we went through the process of of initiating an audit and actually performing an audit, writing the report and validating the report, discussing the report and how all that actually helps an organization to avoid problems and to share knowledge across projects and learning and understanding. And they use auditors as consultants. And the other tools are with respect to cost. We talk about the resource loading chart and how we use that as a foundation to actually build a time based budget. And the resource loading chart, of course, is important for the leveling of the resources, but also it's important to set up that time phase budget that will give us not only the total budget of the project, but the. Cash outflow per period of time that we decide to to use if we want to be micro or macro manager.

And also it helps us to calculate the. Amount of money that is going to cost each of the elements or each of the activities within our project. And that is an important information because we can outsource that and I can open a bidding process based on that amount that we are able to figure out through a time phase budget. Finally, we talk about a lot of soft material related to the human side of project management, the human resources of project management. We talk about the guidelines to make things work and how we go through a process in which the team comes together and share expectations, share values, share knowledge and skills, and then figure out how they're going to work norms and then try to build that culture and try to measure their performance from the technical point of view and from the human point of view, trying to become high performing teams. And just remember high performance team, high performance projects, we need to measure performance two different ways the human performance and the technical performance. Technical performance, the triple constraints cause quality. And time, the degree to which we actually comply with the expectations with respect to these triple constraints set by the customer. But also we talked about how important it is to pay attention to the performance of the project from a human perspective, which includes the learning that has been generated through the process, which again I support and I encourage that we add in every project that we plan an element in the work breakdown structure called learning, so that we make sure that we plan and we have resources assigned to this element that is very important.

So we talk about learning as being one metric to measure the human performance of project, but we also talk about satisfaction of all the key stakeholders involved in the project, and we also talk about the reputation of the project manager, the team and the organization has been important to be recognized as a metric to measure the performance of the project from a human perspective. We also talk about different leadership styles. Remember the coercive, authoritative, democratic and. And many other ones. There are six different leadership styles that we cover that are important to be recognized. One focused more on peoples, one others are more focused on on what we need to do and not so much on people. But in the end, what we saw is that certain different leadership styles is actually the best practice that we all need to follow. We cannot wear a same hat because all these leadership style has some downsides. Then we talk about conflict resolution and how there are different modes of resolving conflicts. That goes from being a a collaborator towards a resolving a conflict and.

Compromising some of your needs or interests or going into being a avoider or avoiding a conflict or being a mediator or trying to ease the emotions, or just accept that you need to live with it or just eliminate it if it is possible to eliminate it by changing some of the scope and capabilities or requirements of that project. We also talk about this very powerful, simple tool called the responsibility Matrix that aligns people or stakeholders with the elements of the work breakdown structure or with activities. And we actually assign responsibilities that can be managerial responsibility is total responsible, needs to be notified. For example. And we also talk about guidelines that can help us to set up performance appraisals, guidelines. And and these are again, these guidelines help us to have a performance appraisal system that may be less likely to have problems with lawsuits and problems with employees being not that satisfied. We all know, based on what I shared on the screens, that on that learning module that performance appraisals are not that good. However, we need to do it because of promotion, because of our training needs and because we need to measure performance so that we can have people responsible and accountable for their actions. So at this point, I just want you to remember that very powerful tool. Continuous improvement tool. Organizational development tool called the Start.

Stop. Continue. That tool can be applied to you as an individual, to your project team, to the whole division in which you perform or to the whole organization or corporation. And it is a very simple tool. It goes from asking yourself or the group of people, what should I start doing to get what I want to go? What should I stop doing to get what I want to go and what should I continue doing to get what I want to go? And so today what I recommend you to do is that you perform this start, stop, continue as many times as you can throughout your career or maybe even in your personal life and and see how powerful actually is. So that is one of my recommendations so that you continue to improve your learning in this area of engineering, management, engineering and technology management and even within the project management domain. So continuous improvement is something that every project manager needs to perform very often in his or her career. So remember the big picture? So you have now a current engineering and technology management state that you would like to move into a future engineering management and technology state. And for that you need to have knowledge on that state. And if we're talking about an engineering, engineering and technology management state that involves project management, that is where 604 actually fits in.

So you are being provided a lot of knowledge on how to manage projects that can help to move that current state into a future state. We also talk about models that help you to make decisions, and there are some other courses within our program that actually can deal with decision making. And we talk about reflection and how this is kind of related to knowledge management and the project environment and the risk management side of decision making. So all moving forward from our understanding, doing some robust decision making process, consider past knowledge and consider risk when we make those decisions and then take actions and help us to move to a better state. So I hope that 604 actually have helped you to understand better that process. And my vision when I started this course was to enable you, an engineer or a manager or a technician or someone with applying science background to go through these 604 course and enable you to become a better manager in the future. I'm sure I'm confident that your capabilities have changed and that you actually are going to become a better manager, a better engineer, a better scientist in the future. So with this, I'm completing this course. I really appreciate your attention and please let us know if there is any question or any thing that you need from us to better serve you. And thank you and take care.",3194,"[-0.00638132 -0.02436805 -0.00085378 ... -0.00141826  0.00112646

"Quality Function Deployment
",10.0,QSD,"Title: Quality Function Deployment; Description: Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is a customer-focused approach that prioritizes their needs and helps drive product development. By using QFD, companies can identify and arrange the right priorities, leading to cost reduction and improved quality. QFD begins with gathering the voice of the customer, where their desires and requirements are identified. These are then turned into operational definitions, which become the focus of the design process.
The House of Quality matrix is a fundamental component of QFD, as it represents the relationship between customer requirements and engineering specifications. This matrix helps prioritize the characteristics desired by customers. By analyzing the matrix, companies can determine the correlations between these characteristics and identify any conflicts. This allows for compromises to be made based on priorities.
QFD is a flexible tool that can be tailored to suit the specific needs of each organization. It helps in orchestrating engineering breakthroughs when needed and facilitates communication between different departments within an organization. The implementation of QFD involves four phases: organization, description, breakthrough, and implementation.
In addition to discussing QFD, the speaker also covered topics such as control charts, statistical process control, process capability, control charts for attributes, experimental design, and response surfaces. These topics provide further insights into ensuring quality in product development.
As the semester is ending, students are advised to take the second test and contact the speaker for any concerns or questions. Overall, QFD is a valuable tool that helps engineers understand and meet customer needs effectively, leading to successful product development.; Transcript: Greetings. Welcome back to ENMA 614, quality systems design, another exciting session. Now, this is going to be our last meeting for this course and I'll go over quality function deployment and then we'll call it a semester or a course and I'll wrap it up. So what I have in mind for this period is to talk about a tool called quality function deployment. I'm sure you have heard about it. This was a integral part of the Typekit moment in the good old days. But since there was a quality consultant behind every bush, they overdid it, I think, but I think it still is an excellent tool to do some sanity check. So, I'm going to go over it quickly and give you some background.

Now, we talked about a product's lifecycle. The first class, if you remember, and the product's lifecycle started with the need right? There's a need and then that need turns into what the customer needs, wants and you learn it from the customer. And then that's turned into engineering requirements. How are you going to respond to what the customer wants, what the need is? How are you going to design it? So you have to make a plan on how to address what the customer wants in engineering terms. 

And once that is done, those engineering terms are taken and you go into detail design and development and the then the production construction. And once that's done, the product is delivered to the customer and the customer and the customer operates it.

And of course, the customer's expectation is that they got what they wanted, and it operates properly, for a specified period of time, while it's in use. And then when the time comes, the product is retired and the life cycle starts over again. Now, we talked about the different phases in some detail in the first class. So let me quickly talk about it again and then we'll go into called function deployment. And as you know, I need to find my eyes, and here they are. And here we go.

So this section, we're going to talk about quality function deployment, Ok. This is a fundamental common sense approach to product development, that focuses on the customer. And it's a technique to help neutralize, sometimes called the voice of the executives.

Now, this is ENMA 614, if you didn't know that and then we talked about the product life-cycle. Right, and the product life cycle started with a need.

Ok.

And so if you develop a product when there is no need, it would be tough to sell it right? And we have a preliminary design, and detailed design and development. And then we had the production construction, whatever you want to call it, and then operation, and retirement, Right?

You remember that retiring the spend would be easy if it stopped working, I would put it in a trash can and somebody picks it up, and I don't even know what happens to it. Well, it goes to the dump somewhere. But retiring a nuclear submarine may be a different issue, right?

So we talked about the product's design, these preliminary design and development. Has the most effect on life cycle costs, right? We saw that about 70 to 80 percent of life cycle costs are determined, the word is committed, not spent, during the design phase.

So, the we know that the design is going to affect how the product is going to be constructed, produced. It's going to affect how it's it's going to be operated, how it's going to be maintained and how it's going to be retired. So, you make all these you lock all these costs at the design phase. So the design phase has the most significant effect.

Now, the design phase is initiated with a need from the customer, so, a tool that may help turning that need into a engineering requirements and that can be utilized during the design phase is called quality function deployment. So that's what I'm going to talk about.

So for that purpose, I have a,presentation here, type of thing. And we're going to talk about quality function deployment. Now, the quality function is a cross-functional planning tool, and it enables prioritizing customer demands, customer wants and developing innovative responses which are reliable and cost effective and the primary focus is what the customer wants.

Now, quality function deployment drives requirements, ranks them in terms of customer desires, and transfers them into engineering specifications. It also identifies key system parameters to be worked on, to be optimized, and quality function surely is a part of a quality system.

Now, why do we want to do quality function deployment? Well, do the right things at the right time, right? Do the right thing right at the first time and at right cost is what everybody wants and this can help. And how to identify and arrange many right things and then prioritize and accomplish them is obviously a challenging task.

So, QFD is a tool to prioritize the customer needs and translate them into design criteria.

Now, the process is driven by the customer, and these requirements will determine if new technologies are needed or a simple improvement of the existing product should suffice and/or a revolutionary concept is required and so on.

Now, this shows a diagram here of a design system. What this chart describes as an old system, a relatively short time is spent defining the product, the product definition stage and a longer time is spent designing the product, and a surprisingly long time is spent, redesigning the product.

And indeed, the key to shortening the overall design time is to better document the design process. This improves the efficiency of the initial design and drastically reduces the need for the redesign.

So, if you take a look at the second, one more time is spent at product definition. And as we have just mentioned, less time is spent on design and significantly less time is spent in the redesign because you have spent a lot of time in defining the product, in addressing what the customer wants.

So, quality function deployment expands the time it takes to define the product, and it shortens the design time again by focusing on priorities and better documenting and communicating the design process. And again, it virtually eliminates the need for redesign.

Now, this diagram came from a book called Quality Function Deployment, it is by Bossert and is published by the American Society of Quality. 

OK.

And it's a nice book, and it's not really tech so easy to read. And another reference I used is this book by Bob King. It's called better designs in half the time.

Ok. So, you can take a look at these and when you do a search, you'll find a lot of, documentation on this, this is nothing new.

Now, what are the benefits of quality function deployment? Well, it's listening to the voice of the customer, giving the customer what they desire and don't try to give them the things they don't really care for because that will increase costs and improve communication between departments.

And it prioritizes improvements, it targets cost reduction and it targets quality, obviously, and it also helps in orchestrating engineering breakthroughs, if they are needed.

Background QFD is created in nineteen seventy-two by Akao at the Kobe shipyards. The need was building a ship is a major undertaking and there are lots of requirements and there are also government regulations and customer requirements. So to ensure all these are met or addressed is not an easy task. So they developed a matrix relating these items to control factors of how and this is how it got started.

This is nothing new, these techniques were utilized under a different name in the US, much earlier. There's lots of documentation on that, too. So, nothing magic there that was invented over there, but again, they made it a cookbook style, easy to apply, way.

So let's go back, now this matrix showed relative importance of each entry and important items are identified and prioritized. And, once those engineering values are determined and prioritized, then you would use different matrices to develop the product further. 

And the book lists about 30 quality function deployment matrices, I'm not going to go into that much detail. We will focus on the first matrix and the extensions can be found by Akao, Clausing, Pugh, and Sullivan. You can take a look at these, references if you have more interest in this. 

Now, the literature shows about these different quality function deployment matrices. You can take a look at those if you need to. There are different matrices for quality characteristics, critique functions, set critical subsystems and cost targets, and so on.

And this goes on, and many companies use quality function deployment extensively with great success. And it's still being used, I believe.

Now, if you take a look at the literature, there are some lessons. Each application of quality function deployment is unique as each organization is unique, and the quickest way to fail is to use someone else's approach.

So, if you took a quality function deployment application from somewhere else and tried to apply it here, it may not work because the way each organization operates and the way the management looks at it is different, maybe different.

So, the key is to learn the basic principles of quality function deployment, and it needs to be tailored to specific needs.

So this is the basic tool of quality function deployment. It's the famous House of Quality matrix. The left wall is customer requirements, in terms of what does the customer want and the right wall is the prioritized customer requirements and the roof is how to address those whats. And the foundation, I guess, is how much. And in between we've got the relationship matrix.

Now, what? Let's go and take a look in more detail to what's. So in this, we are talking about the House of Quality Matrix, ok. It is called the House of Quality because we got the ""what"" here, and we've got the relationship matrix her. We've got the a prioritized customer requirements here. And, this is how much, and this is the relationships, and there is a roof over it, and this is called the... well, I forgot how right? So we got the how's here, and there is a roof, OK?

The roof is a correlation matrix, that's what correlates ""whats"" to house, Ok? So that's the basic structure, that's why it's called the House of Quality, I guess.

Now let's talk about the what's, what is called the voice of the customer. And these are in terms of customer desires and requirements. It's a list of what the customer wants or needs and expectations. This should include all the items that customers want or expect from the product or service under consideration.

These are in adjective or noun form, for example, the customer may say, ""I want low cost, I want a good ride"". If this is a automobile suspension. OK, and it may say, ""Good handling"". OK, it may say hugs the road, OK and comfortable ride and so on, OK, that's what the customer may say. 

Now, obviously a good ride or a comfortable ride may be conflicting with handling or hugs the road, Right. Because a good ride may require a soft suspension and good handling may require a more stiffer suspension, but the customer may put them on all on the same thing. So if you're designing a Camry or you're designing a sports car, they may have different meanings, right? So you have to interpret these rights, writing correctly.

So, How then becomes the voice of the engineer, OK. So each of these initial words needs to be turned into operational definitions. And the objective is to determine a set of quality characteristics by which that ""what"" can be realized and these are called the house.

And they are the quality characteristics, or they are measurable attributes. OK, now, for example, a for the suspension example I was talking about, how do you address a good ride or handling and so on? Well, maybe the damping coefficient or a shock absorber, I guess.

OK and it could be the roll bar or sway bar thickness diameter, OK, or type of material used for the roll bar. 

OK? For the roll bar. 

And, it may be the spring rate, I don't know thickness. I'm not an automobile engineer, but so a customer's objective is turned into measurable quality characteristics. This is how you can address those and others, obviously.

And maybe a other one could be sidewall flex. OK, so a comfortable ride may have a larger sidewall tire and a good handling may have maybe a tire, but a larger rim diameter, but tender here, and this would make the tire wider, right? And it may have better handling and so on.

So this could be one, coefficient and of course, the customer wants, good traction, dry traction. They may want also wet traction, they usually may conflict each other and so on.

So, you'll have to list these whats or the engineering, the house, or how to address the whats. OK, so there may be a whole list of these and how do you prioritize these and put them in order? Could be the issue.

So, then you would take these what's here, OK. Let's say that good ride, and let's say handling, and so on. And how are you going to address these? So you put the what's here, right?

And this could be the damping coefficient, OK. This means this may be the sway bar thickness and this may be the spring rate. OK, and then you will try to find the correlations between these, OK. 

So, and then these are the priorities here, OK. So, then you would need to come up with a way of finding the correlation or the relationship between the damping coefficient and a good ride.

Is there a strong relationship or a medium relationship or a weak relationship? So they developed techniques here or signs, so they would use this and put a number nine.

It could be anything you want to do, I guess.

And this means a strong relationship. So, let's say that there's a strong relationship between damping and and a good ride. And then there may be a medium relationship, between this one and that one, so you put it there and then maybe, maybe there's a weak relationship.

 OK.

Between the spring rate and a good ride, probably not but let me put it here, OK? And then the priorities for a luxury car, this may have a 60 percent priority, right? And this may have, I don't know 20 percent priority. This may have 10 percent priority and so on. So, you multiply that with 9 and come up with some requirements here. 

OK. 

So let's go into a bit more detail of that, the key is the coming up with a how much. Before going into that, let's take a look at analyzing the house of quality matrix.

OK, now in analyzing the household quality matrix, I already mentioned ""what's"" are, these are an adjective and noun. ""How's"" are the quality characteristics and the prioritized the customer requirements are the importance ratings.

And relationships are again, customer requirements are translated into design engineering terms and we are looking at interactions. And how much is the prioritized quality characteristics.

Now, how do we analyze the House of quality metrics? What's a blank column? OK. What happens when you get a blank column? 

OK.

Let's take a look at this. Let's say that there is this one here and there is, let me put this one here and this one here. Something like that, and there is this one here and you have, let me take this out.

You have a blank column, what does a blank column mean? A blank column means that you have got an engineering requirement. OK, let's call this hour one, whatever it may be, some engineering criteria. Now, when you get a blank column, this is a quality characteristics that does not correlate with a customer need.

So, there is no relationship between this engineering criteria your using, with what the customer wants. Now, what does that mean? It means that you're addressing something that the customer does want, maybe it is painted or I don't know, red painted suspension or something, I'm getting a bit, uh, you know, out of here.

Or maybe raised letters on a tire and so on. The customer doesn't want it, so don't do it. Ok. Save some money, but it may be that the customer didn't mention it, but it is necessary as a safety or a government regulation issue. Then you will need to put it in there, of course. 

But it gives you a way of analyzing this matrix. Usually, a blank column means that, uh, characteristics that do not strongly correlate with any customer want. 

A blank row on the other hand, is a customer demand that's not addressed by a quality characteristics. So you will have to think about how to address maybe the customer wants Ray's letters on the tire, so you have to think about how to do that and maybe add another a row in here.

So the relationships here is you do the analysis of between ""what's"" and ""how's"" and look for blank columns, blank rows. And try to depending on the prioritize requirements (what the customer prioritizes), you will need to find the relationships between ""what's"" and ""how's"".We can display that using these symbols. 

Ok. 

So we talked about the relationships, this can also identify the conflicts by looking at the roof. OK, now there may be conflicts between a soft suspension, a comfortable ride and the hugs the road desire. So you will need to make some compromises here, defined based on some priorities, OK.

So, in order to give an example let's talk about tire development, I guess, and the customer wants ""what"" right? And it says road holding, let's say tire life, they want good mileage, they may say traction, let's say on the wet. 

And what else would the customer want from a tire? They may say it is noise, tire noise. And what else? There may be other things here when you hit it on the curb, you don't want the tire to be damaged and so on. But let's leave it at that to make it simple.

So how do we address these? Well, in order to address this, you can take a look at a tread wear. It could be traction coefficient, I guess. I don't know what it is. Some resistance coefficient. It could be a sidewall flex and so on.

So this is how you may address this and you may develop a matrix here. So holding, road holding, let's say, and tire life mileage and traction and what else did I say, noise? So these are the the plots. Let's put a section on house, let's say that this is wear (tire wear). And this could be the wet traction, depending on a certain rubber I guess. And this could be the resistance we talked about. This could be the flex of the sidewalk. And how are we, this is how we can address these.

So there may be a strong relationship between these two and a medium relationship here, and a weak relationship here, and a strong relationship here, and there may be a weak relationship here, which probably is not true. Let me make it something like this, and there may be a strong relationship here, a strong relationship here, and a noise and flex, I guess, so let's put a medium relationship here, something like this.

And once this is done based on the priorities, you can come up with some values here. Let's say that the tread wear would be, let's say, half an inch in twenty-five thousand miles. Let's say that the wet traction should be, I don't know, .65g at skid and the resistance could be some number here and the flex could be some pounds here and so on.

So you took the words, you found the engineering terms and you turn them into values, Ok. This then, you can take then these turn them into ""what's"" of the next matrix.

The next matrix then may look something like this, wear and traction, and let's say that resistance. So it goes into more details here. This this may be the tensile strength. So this can be the modulus, (I'm kind of making this up) hardness and so on, don't let me write the whole thing.

So this is the next matrix. So we took we took the ""house"" and turned them into ""what's"" and then we have another house. So these are the ""what's"" and these are the ""house"", so it's getting more detailed. You can take a look at this one it could be something like this could be something like that.

And maybe there's a strong relationship here and there's a strong relationship there. I don't know, I'm making it up, something like this. Once this is done, this becomes the whats for another matrix. So this is how you can expand this thing and go on.

So I'll try to give you an understanding of how this thing works. It's basically identifying the need, the proper need and once the proper needs identified, you address the...

From an engineer's perspective, how to address those needs. Where do the needs come from?

Well, the needs come from customer service. You have to be careful there, because sometimes those customer service may be misleading. And we see many examples of those out there. One thing I heard was that they...

(A student told me this I don't know if it's true or not). 

They were designing a new submarine that could operate under certain depth or something. And when the engineers developed this criteria of this new product, but once the user came and the engineers came into the same room and they did this matrix, they found out that the customer didn't need that much performance at a certain area. The reason is that they don't operate it in those conditions, I guess. And yet the engineers were addressing something that the customer didn't really want.

So maybe that is a blank column, right? Of course, if you increase the performance of a product or a defense system, the price goes up. If it needs to operate at a much larger debt, it's going to be stronger, thicker and heavier and much more costly. 

I remember this presentation by some guy at NASA, they had a requirement for a cargo plane to land on a bombed out field. So they developed the most complex, landing gear, and it ended up costing as much as the airplane. And it ended up causing so much reliability and maintenance problems that it was a nightmare. And somebody asked, did they ever land it on a field like that? And they said, yes once and we lost the plane.

So the the important thing is not to dream up with something that can be done technically, but ask the customer what they want. And this may enable, something like that. It brings the customer and the engineer together, and they look at what the requirements may be, and you look at blank rows and blank columns and save a lot of time and money.

It also enables communication between departments. For example, a certain manufacturer may not want to do more than a certain number of stamping on a car fender, and this may require more than that. So the engineering design criteria, so it brings them together to make the design change, so it will be simpler to be built a more robust design.

So, this is a nice tool in that sense, it's just paychecks you put together, that brings the customer and the engineer together. So it's a it's a nice tool. Now let's take a look at how do we apply this thing.

There are four phases in the QFD process:

First organization, the management selects the project, the appropriate interdepartmental team focuses, defines the focus on the QFD study. 

Then there's the descriptive phase, the team defines the product from several different directions; customer demands, functions, subsystems, reliability and cost. As we mentioned earlier, the customer may not specifically show a demand for something, but it may be a reliability issue or a government regulation issue or a cost issue. So all these need to be addressed.

And the breakthrough phase is the the team does the analysis and selects the areas for improvement and find ways to make them better through new technology, new concepts, better reliability, cost reduction and so on.

And the implementation phase is that the team defines the new product and how it will be manufactured and operated.

So I try to give you a basic idea of what this is, and you can find a lot of resources in the literature for this. It can be a very useful tool in driving the requirements, and what the customer wants. So don't try to address something that's not really needed and the user, the operator, the customer must be involved in the design process.

So those people who actually operate the sub or the ship or whatever it may be, their voices need to be heard. Rather than just the management and the management from the other side deciding on the technical requirements.

So this is this can be helpful. This brings me to the end of the semester and we covered quite a bit. And I hope that it went smoothly and the next thing to do is the second test.

So take that like the first one and then send it to us, and we'll take care of it in terms of grading and so on. So what did we do? I got the syllabus here.

Now we talked about control charts, OK, statistical process control. And we talked about describing variation. We said that variation is a fact of life. And if you can separate with between the chance causes of variation and assignable causes of variation, you can control the production process.

So based on that idea, control charts were developed for the mean and the range. And we saw those called X chart and R chart. And the nice thing about those charts were that they were based on a normal distribution, due to the central limit theorem. And we saw some applications of it, and we saw the chances of making an error type one error and type two error.

And then we talked about process capability, we talked about the Six Sigma and other measures of it. And then we talked about control charts for attributes where you don't measure anything, but the quality is decided on as an attribute. If you take a light bulb and put it in a socket, if it's done, it's good. So you counted the number of light bulbs that didn't light up to come up with a quality idea.

This is cheaper quicker, but it doesn't give as detailed information as the X and R charts. And we saw the P chart and the P chart for that purpose. And those were different based on different distributions, not on the normal distribution. And I gave you a basic idea behind the statistics for that.

Then we had that first test and afterwards we started about, designed experimentation. That we said is necessary to come up with finding out what the problem is. So if you're using the control charts and you get out of control points continuously, there's a problem. You have to stop the process and find out what the problem is. Now, one way of doing this is designed experimentation, I tried to give you the basics because this can be a course by itself.

We talked about two level control charts, two level design of experiments 2^k designs. We saw, full factorial designs 2^k and we saw how to analyze them. We saw response surfaces, we saw the math model. And sometimes we said 2^k can grow rather quickly. So we looked at the fractions and the fractional factorial designs, I showed you how to develop half fractions. And there are more fractions of that 1/8th fractions and 1/16th fractions and so on.

We saw Taguchi orthogonal arrays, I gave you a few examples. The fractional factorial designs worked because they made the use of the fact that we do not need to estimate all the interactions. We said that it can be shown in practice shows that higher order interactions tend to be negligible. So we placed more main effects instead of the higher order fractions. But we said that the main effects and two factor interactions should not be confounded with each other because two factor interactions can be strong, sometimes stronger than the main effects.

I also talked about, uh, multiple level experiments. I gave you examples of the Taguchi three level orthogonal arrays. Those can get a bit controversial complicated, but those are good designs, the two I have given you. You can utilize them for non continuous experiments where you may be using three different catalysts, three different processes, three different operators, three different materials and so on.

And I gave you a couple of examples and this session we talked about QFD. And that brings me to the end. So, take the second test and send it to us now, or if you've got comments questions, feel free to contact me at the information I have given you. Take Care.",6326,"[-0.00998702  0.01024572 -0.00345325 ... -0.00024763 -0.02264269
