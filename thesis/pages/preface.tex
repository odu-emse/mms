\prefacesection{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I want to thank my advisor, Dr. Yaohang Li, for his guidance and support throughout my graduate studies. The artificial intelligence classes he taught were a powerful motivator that pointed me in the direction my career is now headed. 

I would also like to thank the entire faculty and staff at Engineering Management \& Systems Engineering Department at Old Dominion University for their tireless efforts to make the asynchronous program a continuous success and for facilitating the creation of the Module Clustering System, the Module Management System along with the GLACE user interface platform.

I cannot thank my wife enough for constantly encouraging me to pursue my passions, reminding me to trust my instincts, and never to give up on my dreams. They have been a constant source of support, and I couldn't have completed my master's degree without them.

Lastly, I want to express my deep appreciation to my mother. Her support ever since my undergraduate studies made it possible to pursue my passion and master's degree. I will be forever grateful.
