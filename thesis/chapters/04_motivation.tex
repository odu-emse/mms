% a.	The pilot phase of the project was where requirements were defined, and I was tasked with doing User Experience research along with the design of a User Interface prototype.
% i.	Met with advisors, students, ITS, and CLT (now ODU Global) to gain insights into the needs and limitations of each actor.
% b.	As a Graduate Assistant, I had the privilege of leading a team of 9 student engineers collaborating on creating GLANCE, the LMS that ingests the MMS outputs.
% c.	Online education is my preferred career field as a software engineer working on learning management systems and its supporting components. I plan to continue my career at Instructure, the creator and maintainer of Canvas LMS.

My motivation for online education stems from my experiences and struggles as a student. I have been a student at Old Dominion University since 2016, and I have taken various courses in online and in-person formats and in synchronous and asynchronous methods. I have also been a student worker at the institution since 2018, and I have worked in a variety of roles within graduate assistantship that have given me a unique perspective on the institution's distance learning efforts. Unsurprisingly, I have been determined to continue my career in online education as a software engineer working on learning management systems and its supporting components.
