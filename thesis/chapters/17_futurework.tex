Future works' most important focus should start with creating modularized course content. This would require a massive allocation of funds and efforts by institutions or organizations. Programmatically, the system could be improved by implementing hyperparameter tuning on the clustering algorithms and implementing additional clustering algorithms.

Developing the Module Management System is also crucial to future work. The MMS is responsible for the reinforcement learning aspect of the system, which would optimize the time spent in school for students and implement an advisor-to-student feedback loop. The feedback loop would allow students to feel more in control over their degree path and not feel like they are being told what to take on a course-by-course basis. Finally, developing more delivery methods for each module would facilitate more effective learning for each student.
