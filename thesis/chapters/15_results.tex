Sadly, evaluating the system's accuracy is hard for many reasons regarding the final product. First and foremost, the sample size was extremely small for a task such as machine learning and especially when considering that the main objective was text analysis and classification. The first objective of any future work on this subject is content creation or at least expanding the features used for machine learning. Secondly, the data used included courses that need modularization, making it difficult to evaluate the results with such an abstract dataset. Regardless, the final output of the system is still usable as it is just a JSON structure. The idea behind this is to facilitate a standardized way of communication for utilizing this system in the future.
